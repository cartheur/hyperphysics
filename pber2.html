This is demonstrated at left in three vertical tubes that are attached to a glass venturi tube. The middle tube is attached at the constriction. The air pressure tends to push the liquid in the tubes downward, so the  higher water level in the center tube indicates that the pressure is lower there. </p></td></tr></table><table><tr><td><p>The flow in this system is from left to right, driven by a high pressure air supply. Note that the liquid level  in the right hand tube is slightly higher, indicating that the pressure there is slightly less than that at the left hand tube. This is indicative of the normal pressure drop in a flowing fluid since the diameters of the top tube are the same at the left and right tubes.  </p></td><td><img src="fluids/flupic/bern5.jpg"></td></tr></table></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="bercon.html">Bernoulli concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="hph.html#mechcon">     Mechanics </A>*****<A HREF="fluid.html#flucon">     Fluids </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="pdrop"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Pressure Drop with Length</H1><p> The pressure drop as fluid flows from a container can be modeled by <a href= "ppois.html#poi" >Poiseuille's law</a>.
