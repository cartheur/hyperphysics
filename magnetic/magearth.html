It does seem clear that the generation of the magnetic field is linked to the rotation of the earth, since Venus with a similar iron-core composition but a 243 Earth-day rotation period does not have a measurable magnetic field. It certainly seems plausible that it depends upon the rotation of the fluid metallic iron which makes up a large portion of the interior, and the rotating conductor model leads to the term "dynamo effect" or "geodynamo", evoking the image of an <a href= "genwir.html#c1" >electric generator</a>. </p>    <p> <a href= "../thermo/heatra.html#c3" >Convection</a> drives the outer-core fluid and it circulates relative to the earth. This means the electrically conducting material moves relative to the <a href= "#c1" >earth's magnetic field</a>. If it can obtain a charge by some interaction like friction between layers, an effective current loop could be produced. The magnetic field of a <a href= "curloo.html#c1" >current loop</a> could sustain the magnetic dipole type magnetic field of the earth. Large-scale computer models are approaching a realistic simulation of such a geodynamo. </p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><font size="+1"><a href="#c1">Earth's magnetic field</a></font></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="magcon.html#c1">Magnetic field concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="bcursrc.html#c1">Currents as magnetic sources</a><BR><BR>Reference<br><a href="../electric/eleref.html#c1">Ladbury</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../emcon.html#emcon">     Electricity and Magnetism </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
