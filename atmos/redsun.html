Just before the sun disappears from view, its actual position is about a diameter below the horizon, the light having been bent by <a href="../geoopt/refr.html#c1">refraction</a> to reach our eyes.  Since short wavelengths are more efficiently scattered by <a href="blusky.html#c2">Rayleigh scattering</a>, more of them are scattered out of the beam of sunlight before it reaches you. Aerosols and particulate matter contribute to the scattering of blue out of the beam, so brilliant reds are seen when there are many airborne particles, as after volcanic eruptions.   </p> <center><img src="imgatm/redsun.gif"></center><p>The equivalent phenomenon can be seen at sunrise</p><table><tr><td><img src="atmpic/redsundark.jpg"></td><td>This shows an early morning sun with the exposure dark enough so that the light from the Sun does not saturate the CCD detector.

A small amount of morning fog enhanced the red by Rayleigh scattering out more blue, I am guessing. Successive exposures at about 1 stop difference were taken and the sun from the darker one transferred over the sun image in the lighter one.  </td></tr></table><p>The redness of the sun is about as it appeared to the eye, but the remainder of the sky is much darker than it appeared to the eye, pointing to the remarkable contrast handling ability of human vision. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="atmoscon.html#c1">Atmospheric optics concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../ligcon.html#c1">     Light and Vision </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c2"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Green Flash</H1><p>The famous but seldom seen "green flash" or "emerald flash" which occurs just before the last part of the sun disappears from view at sunset is caused by the same atmospheric <a href="../geoopt/refr.html#c1">refraction</a> and <a href="blusky.html#c2">scattering</a> effects which produce the <a href="#c1">red sunset</a>.      </p> <center><img src="imgatm/gflash.gif"></center><p> A rich subject for debate over the years, the green flash is rarely seen, but its observers wax eloquent about the brilliant green or emerald color when it is seen. In uniform air, the dispersion is apparently so small that the separation of red and green images is not visible. It takes more unusual layering of the atmosphere to enhance the separation.</p><p> Such a seldom seen and dramatic effect as the green flash tends to collect myth, so some care must be taken to separate fact from myth. I had reported from another reference that the perceived brilliance of the green might be heightened by the low-light enhancement of green vs the red end of the spectrum (see "<a href="../vision/rodcone.html#c5">Rods do not see red!</a>" in <a href="../vision/colpuz.html#c1">color puzzles</a>). Andrew Young contests this, stating that sunsets are so bright and provide so much light even in the green that significant bleaching of the pigment for both red and green may occur, certainly not the conditions for the <a href="../vision/bright.html#c2">scotopic</a> or low-light vision.  Young maintains an excellent website of resources about green flashes, "<a href="http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/">An Introduction to Green Flashes</a>".</p>       <p> The index of refraction for red is 1.000292 and that for blue is 1.000295. Out of a total refraction of about 0.53&#176;, the dispersion is only 0.006&#176; or about 20 arc seconds, compared to a 120 arc sec resolution for the eye. Thus under normal conditions the eye would not see this. </p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="#c3">Some history</a></td><td><a href="#c4">More numerical detail</a></td></tr></table></center><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="greenmaybe.html#c1">A hint of a green flash</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="atmoscon.html#c1">Atmospheric optics concepts</a><BR><BR>References<br><a href="../optics/optref.html#c1">Schaaf<br><br>Greenler<br><br>Meinel & Meinel<br><br>Minnaert</a><br><br><a href="http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/"><img src="imgatm/exlnk.gif" ><br>Green Flash</a><br>by Andrew Young</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../ligcon.html#c1">     Light and Vision </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c3"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Green Flash History</H1><p> Jules Verne's 1882 novel "Le Rayon Vert" (The Green Ray) popularized the <a href="#c2">green flash</a>, described as </p>    <p>"a green which no artist could ever obtain on his palette, a green of which neither the varied tints of vegetation nor the shades of the most limpid sea could ever produce the like!

Also displayed there is  a photograph taken when Venus was 10 degrees above the horizon which has a very different appearance.
