It is the nature of the homogeneous solution that the equation gives a zero value. If you find a particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation, you can add the homogeneous solution to that solution and it will still be a solution since its net result will be to add zero. This does not mean that the homogeneous solution adds no meaning to the picture; the homogeneous part of the solution for a physical situation helps in the understanding of the physical system. A  solution can be formed as the sum of the homogeneous and non-homogeneous solutions, and it will have a number of arbitrary (undetermined) constants. Such a solution is called the general solution to the differential equation. For application to a physical problem, the constants must be determined by forcing the solution to fit physical <a href="#c4">boundary conditions</a>. Once a general solution is formed and then forced to fit the physical boundary conditions, one can be confident that it is the unique solution to the problem, as gauranteed by the <a href="#c5">uniqueness theorem</a>.                                 </TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="hframe.html">Index</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="hph.html#hph">HyperPhysics</A>****<a href="hmat.html#hmath">HyperMath</a>*****<a href= "de.html#deh" >Differential equations</a></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c4"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Boundary Conditions</H1>The boundary conditions on a <a href="#c1">differential equation</a> are the constraining values of the function at some particular value of the independent variable. For example, if the equation involves the velocity, the boundary condition might be the initial velocity, the velocity at time t=0. In order to have a complete solution, there must be a boundary condition for each order of the equation - two boundary conditions for  a second order equation, only one necessary for a first order differential equation. If a solution to a differential equation is found which satisfies all the boundary conditions, then it is the only solution to that equation - this is called the <a href="#c5">uniqueness theorem</a>. Therefore, a reasonable approach to finding solutions to differential equations in physical problems is to use a trial solution and try to force it to fit the boundary conditions. If successful, then this approach finds the unique solution.                           </TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="hframe.html">Index</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="hph.html#hph">HyperPhysics</A>****<a href="hmat.html#hmath">HyperMath</a>*****<a href= "de.html#deh" >Differential equations</a></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c5"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Uniqueness Theorem</H1> <p>For the <a href="#c1">differential equations</a> applicable to physical problems, it is often possible to start with a general form and force that form to fit the physical <a href="#c4">boundary conditions</a> of the problem.
