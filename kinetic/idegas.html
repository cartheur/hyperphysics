One can visualize it as a collection of perfectly hard spheres which collide but which otherwise do not interact with each other. In such a gas, all the <a href= "../thermo/inteng.html#c2" >internal energy</a> is in the form of kinetic energy and any change in internal energy is accompanied by a change in <a href= "../thermo/temper.html#c1" >temperature</a>.</p>     <p>An ideal gas can be characterized by three <a href="#c3">state variables</a>: absolute pressure (P), volume (V), and absolute temperature (T).

It must be inherently single-valued to characterize a state. For example in the <a href="../thermo/heat.html#c2">heat-work example</a>, the final state is characterized by a specific temperature (a state variable) regardless of whether it was brought to that state by heating, or by having work done onit, or both. </p>     <p>Common examples of state variables are the pressure P, volume V, and temperature T. In the <a href="#c1">ideal gas law</a>, the state of n moles of gas is precisely determined by these three state variables. If a property, e.g., <a href= "../thermo/firlaw.html#c2" >enthalpy</a> H, isdefined as a combination of other state variables, then it too is a state variable. Enthalpy is one of the four "<a href="../thermo/thepot.html#c1">thermodynamic potentials</a>", and the other three, <a href="../thermo/inteng.html#c2">internal energy</a> U, <a href="../thermo/helmholtz.html#c1">Helmholtz free energy</a> F and <a href="../thermo/helmholtz.html#c2">Gibbs free energy</a> G are also state variables.

If it is completely flat, it still has the <a href= "../pman.html#atm" >atmospheric pressure</a> air in it. To be sure, it has zero useful pressure in it, and your tire gauge would read zero pounds per square inch. Most gauges read the excess of pressure over atmospheric pressure and this excess is called "gauge pressure".  While a useful measurement for many practical purposes, it must be converted to absolute pressure for applications like the <a href= "#c1" >ideal gas law</a>.</p><p>Since a partial vacuum will be below atmospheric pressure, the phrase "negative pressure" is often used. Certainly there is no such thing as a negative absolute pressure, but small decreases in pressure are commonly used to entrain fluids in sprayers, in carburetors for automobiles, and many other applications. In the case of <a href="henry.html#c5">respiration</a>, we say that the lungs produce a negative pressure of about -4 mmHg to take in air, which of course means a 4 mmHg decrease from the surrounding atmospheric pressure. </p><center><img src="imgkin/gauge.gif"></center><center><table><tr><td><img src="kinpic/pgauge.jpg"></td><td><img src="kinpic/pgauge2.jpg"></td></tr></table></center><p>When a system is at atmospheric pressure like the left image above, the gauge pressure is said to be zero.

In the right image, the system has been closed and the plunger pushed down until the pressure reads about 15 lb/in<sup>2</sup>. This implies that the absolute pressure has been approximately doubled by compressing the gas to half its volume (ideal gas law). Standard <a href="../pman.html#atm">atmospheric pressure</a> in these U.S. common units is 14.7 lb/in<sup>2</sup>, so this must be added to the gauge pressure above to get the absolute pressure.</p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="ktcon.html#c1">Kinetic theory concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../heacon.html#heacon">     Thermodynamics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c6"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Ideal Gas Law with Constraints</H1><p>For the purpose of calculations, it is convenient to place the <a href="#c1">ideal gas law</a> in the form:</p>     <center><img src="imgkin/pvt.gif"></center><br>where the subscripts i and f refer to the initial and final states of some process.
