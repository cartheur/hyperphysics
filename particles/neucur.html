The interaction of the Z<sup>0</sup> is somewhat more subtle. The interaction of the Z<sup>0</sup> with a quark does not change its color, and its interaction with a lepton does not change its charge. The interaction of the Z<sup>0</sup> with electrons can be represented by a <a href="expar.html#c2">Feynman diagram</a>.</p><center><img src="../forces/imgfor/feynz.gif"></center><p>Referred to as a "neutral current" this Z<sup>0</sup> interaction is very difficult to detect because it is masked by the much stronger electromagnetic interaction with which it is compared above. </p><p>Theoretically, the neutral current is important since it represents an essential part of the picture of <a href="../forces/unify.html#c1">electroweak unification</a>. It was observed in 1973  in neutrino scattering experiments, and that connection has become more important in recent years as a part of the resolution of the <a href="../Astro/solneu.html#c1">solar neutrino problem</a>. The researchers at the <a href="neutrino.html#c3">Sudbury Neutrino Observatory</a> have addressed this problem with a program to detect the following neutrino interactions.</p> <center><img src="imgpar/sud.gif"></center>  <p>A look at these interactions in terms of Feynman diagrams can perhaps suggest why the probabilities for these interactions are different, a situation which helps in the modeling of the solar neutrino behavior.</p><center><img src="imgpar/feyncr.gif"></center><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="sno.html#c1">Neutrino detection at SNO</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="parcon.html">Particle concepts</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="../quaref.html">Griffiths</a><br>Ch 2<br><br><a href="../quaref.html">McDonald, Klein & Wark</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../quacon.html#quacon">     Quantum Physics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></body>
