The gluon can be considered to be the fundamental exchange particle underlying the <a href="../forces/funfor.html#c2">strong interaction</a> between protons and neutrons in a nucleus. That short-range nucleon-nucleon interaction can be considered to be a residual color force extending outside the boundary of the proton or neutron. That strong interaction was modeled by <a href="hadron-2.html#c7">Yukawa</a> as involving an exchange of <a href="hadron-2.html#c2">pions</a>, and indeed the <a href="../forces/exchg.html#c4">pion range calculation</a> was helpful in developing our understanding of the strong force. </p><table><tr><td>Gluon interactions are often represented by a <a href="#c2">Feynman diagram</a>. Note that thegluon generates a color change forthe quarks.  The gluons are in fact considered to be bi-colored, carrying a unit of color and a unit of anti-color as suggested in the diagram at right. The gluon exchange picture there converts a blue quark to a green one and vice versa. The range of the strong force is limited by the fact that the gluons interact with each other as well as with quarks in the context of <a href="quark-2.html#c6">quark confinement</a>. These properties contrast them with photons, which are massless and of infinite range. The photon does not carry electric charge with it, while the gluons do carry the "color charge".</p></td><td><img src="imgpar/gluon-2.gif"></td></tr></table>  <p>Within their range of about a fermi, the gluons can interact with each other, and can produce virtual quark-antiquark pairs. The property of interaction with each other is very different from the other exchange particles, and raises the possibility of gluon collections referred to as "glueballs". The internal state of a <a href="hadron-2.html#c5">hadron</a> is viewed as composed of a fixed net number of quarks, but with a dynamic cloud of gluons and quark-antiquark pairs in equilibrium. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="parcon-2.html">Particle concepts</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="parref-2.html">Griffiths</a><Br>Section 2.3</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../quacon.html#quacon">     Quantum Physics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c2"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Feynman Diagrams</H1> <p>Feynman diagrams are graphical ways to represent <a href= "../forces/exchg.html#c1" >exchange forces</a>.

They are spacetime diagrams, ct vs x. The time axis points upward and the space axis to the right. (Particle physicists often reverse that orientation.) Particles are represented by lines with arrows to denote the direction of their travel, with antiparticles having their arrows reversed. Virtual particles are represented by wavy or broken lines and have no arrows. All electromagnetic interactions can be described with combinations of primitive diagrams like this one.  </td><td><img src="imgpar/feyn-2.gif"></table><table><tr><td><img src="imgpar/feynm2-2.gif">  </td><td><p>Only lines entering or leaving the diagram represent observable particles.

They were predicted by Weinberg, Salam, and Glashow in 1979 and measured at <a href="cern-2.html#c1">CERN</a> in 1982. The prediction included a prediction of the masses of these particles as a part of the unified theory of the electromagnetic and weak forces, the <a href= "../forces/unify.html#c1" >electroweak unification</a>. "If the weak and electromagnetic forces are essentially the same, then they must also have the same strength. The fact that the experimentally observed strengths seem quite different is attributed to the masses of the W and Z particles-under certain conditions a force of large strength can have the appearance of a force of small strength if the particle that carries the force is very massive. Theoretical calculations show that at a fundamental level the weak and electromagnetic forces have the same strength if the W and Z particles have masses of 80 and 90 GeV respectively." The masses measured at CERN were 82 and 93 GeV, a brilliant confirmation of the electroweak unification. </p><p>The experiments at CERN detected a total of 10 W bosons and 4 Z bosons.
