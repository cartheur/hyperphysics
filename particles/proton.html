It is possible for a proton to be transformed into a neutron, but you have to supply 1.29 MeV of energy to reach the threshold for that transformation. In the very early stages of the <a href="../astro/bbcloc.html#c1">big bang</a> when the thermal energy was much greater than 1.29 MeV, we surmise that the transformation between protons and neutrons was proceeding freely in both directions so that there was an essentially equal population of protons and neutrons. </a><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="neutrondis.html#c1">Discovery of the neutron</a></td><td><a href="#c4">Decay of the neutron</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="parcon.html">Particle concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../quacon.html#quacon">     Quantum Physics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c4"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Decay of the Neutron</H1> <table><tr><td>     <p>A free <a href="#c3">neutron</a> will decay with a <a href= "../nuclear/halfli.html#c1" >half-life</a> of about 10.3 minutes but it is stable if combined into a nucleus.

The observed momentum and energy distributions for the electron are as shown below.</p><center><img src="imgpar/neutmom.gif"></center><p>The fact that the electrons produced from the neutron decay had continuous distributions of energy and momentum was a clear indication that there was another particle emitted along with the electron and proton. It had to be a neutral particle and in certain decays carried almost all the energy and momentum of the decay. This would not have been so extraordinary except for the fact that when the electron had its maximum kinetic energy, it accounted for <u>all</u> the energy Q available for the decay. So there was no energy left over to account for the mass energy of the other emitted particle. The early experimenters were faced with the dilemma of a particle which could carry nearly all the energy and momentum of the decay but which had no charge and apparently no mass!</p><p>The mysterious particle was called a neutrino, but it was twenty five years before unambiguous experimental observation of the neutrino was made by <a href="cowan.html#c1">Cowan and Reines</a>.
