The electron neutrino (a <a href="lepton.html#c1">lepton</a>) was first postulated in 1930 by Wolfgang Pauli to explain why the electrons in <a href="../nuclear/beta.html#c3">beta decay</a> were not emitted with the full reaction energy of the nuclear transition. The apparent violation of conservation of energy and momentum was most easily avoided by postulating another particle. Enrico Fermi called the particle a neutrino and developed a theory of beta decay based on it, but it was not <a href="#c2">experimentally observed</a> until 1956. This elusive particle, with no charge and <a href="#c6">almost no mass</a>, could penetrate vast thicknesses of material without interaction. The mean free path of a neutrino in water would be on the order of 10x the distance from the Earth to the Sun.  In the standard <a href="../astro/bbang.html#c1">Big Bang model</a>, the neutrinos left over from the creation of the universe are the most abundant particles in the universe. This remnant neutrino density is put at 100 per cubic centimeter at an effective temperature of 2K (Simpson). The background temperature for neutrinos is lower than that for the <a href="../bkg3k.html#c1">microwave background</a> (2.7K) because the neutrino <a href="../astro/bbcloc.html#c3">transparency point</a> came earlier. The sun emits vast numbers of neutrinos which can pass through the earth with little or no interaction. This leads to the statement "Solar neutrinos shine down on us during the day, and shine up on us during the night!" . Bahcall's modeling of the solar neutrino flux led to the prediction of about 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> neutrinos/cm<sup>2</sup>s. </p>     <p> A remarkable opportunity for observing neutrinos came with <a href="#c5">Supernova 1987A</a> when the Japanese observing team detected neutrinos almost coincident with the discovery of the light from the supernova.  </p><p>Neutrinos interact only by the <a href= "../forces/funfor.html#c4" >weak interaction</a>.

It should allow them to determine whether neutrinos change flavors. If so, it could explain the <a href=../Astro/solneu.html#c1">solar neutrino problem</a> and would show that the neutrinos have mass.  </p><p>SNO began operating in production mode in October, 1999, and as of Summer 2000 had collected a sizable number of neutrino events both from the sun (the main focus of the experiment) and from atmospheric  events with pions and muons. The Cerenkov cones of the solar neutrinos center about the direction opposite the sun, showing about the same flux at night as during the day. This was an expected result, since the mean free path of a neutrino in matter is about 22 lightyears in lead and having the earth in the path makes little difference.  A sizable number of the atmospheric neutrino events come from below, having traveled all the way through the earth and forming the Cerenkov cone in the photomultiplier tubes at the top of the spherical heavy-water ball. These Cerenkov cones are scattered all around the sphere, while the solar ones of course show a precise anti-solar direction. </p> <p>The depth of the detector protects it from the intense bombardment of <a href="../Astro/cosmic-2.html">cosmic ray</a> muons which reaches the earth's surface. The detector measures only about 70 muon events per day, and they are easily distinguished from neutrino events since the muon interacts by the electromagnetic interaction and produces a much larger signal in the detector array.</p><p>In order to detect the ring of light which is the signature of Cerenkov radiation, the responses of all the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are monitored with a very short time scale.

The detector consists of a 378,000 liter tank of perchloroethylene, which is further isolated by being submerged in water.

But this raises certain theoretical problems and there have been many attempts to set a range for the mass of the neutrino. Since its mass is evidently very small, if non-zero, the mass is usually stated in terms of its <a href="../relativ/releng.html#c2">energy equivalent</a> in <a href="../electric/ev.html#c1">electron volts</a>. Most experiments conclude that the mass equivalent of the neutrino is less than 50 eV. </p>     <p>One of the  recent pieces of information about neutrino mass came from the neutrinos observed from <a href="../astro/sn87a.html#c2">Supernova 1987A</a>. Ten neutrinos arrived within 15 seconds of each other after traveling 180,000 light years, and they differed by a up to factor of three in energy.

The interpretation of the data suggested a mass difference between electron and muon neutrinos of 0.03 to 0.1 eV.
