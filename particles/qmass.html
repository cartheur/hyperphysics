<HEAD>   <TITLE>Quark Masses</TITLE></HEAD><body bgcolor="#FFE4C8"><!-- Copyright 1999 by Carl Rod Nave, RodNave@gsu.edu--><A Name="c1"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>The Mystery of Quark Mass</H1> <table><tr><td><img src="imgpar/pimas.gif"></td><td><p> The combination of up and down <a href="quark.html#c1">quarks</a> to form <a href= "proton.html#c1" >protons</a> and <a href= "proton.html#c3" >neutrons</a> suggests that the u and d are of about equal mass: about 1/3 the mass of a nucleon.</p><p>But in the extraordinary case of the <a href= "hadron.html#c2" >pion</a>, an up and antidown quark combination has a mass energy of only 140 MeV! Yet the same quark combination in a <a href="meson2.html#c2">rho meson</a> has a mass energy of 770 MeV! The concept of mass is a lot stranger than classical physics would suggest.</p> </td></tr></table><p>The difference between a pion and a rho is the spin alignment of the quarks. The pion is a <a href="haddia.html#c1">pseudoscalar meson</a> with zero angular momentum. The quarks have spin 1/2 and the spins are "paired" or anti-aligned. In the rho meson, a <a href="haddia.html#c2">vector meson</a>,  the angular momentum is j=1, indicating parallel spins. Under the influence of the strong <a href= "../forces/color.html#c1" >color force</a>, the state with spins aligned has a higher energy which shows up as a larger mass energy. The analogy to the higher energy of aligned spins in a magnetic field (<a href= "../quantum/zeeman.html#c2" >Zeeman effect</a>) is instructive, but this difference in energy associated with the color force is enormous. </p><center><img src="imgpar/pirho.gif"></center><p>Georgi comments "There is good reason to believe that most of the mass of the quark that we 'see' in the mass of the proton or the rho is a dynamical effect of quark confinement, that the u and d quarks in the underlying QCD theory actually have masses much smaller than 1/3 the mass of the proton."</p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="parcon.html">Particle concepts</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="../quaref.html">Georgi</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../quacon.html#quacon">     Quantum Physics </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
