However, the amount of force required to move an object starting from rest is usually greater than the force required to keep it moving at constant velocity once it is started. Therefore two coefficients of friction are sometimes quoted for a given pair of surfaces - a coefficient of static friction and a coefficent of kinetic friction. The force expression above can be called the standard model of surface friction and is dependent upon several <a href="frict3.html#ass">assumptions</a> about friction. </p> <p>While this general description of friction (which I will refer to as the standard model) has practical utility, it is by no means a precise description of friction. Friction is in fact a very complex phenomenon which cannot be represented by a simple model. Almost every simple statement you make about friction can be countered with specific examples to the contrary. Saying that rougher surfaces experience more friction sounds safe enough - two pieces of coarse sandpaper will obviously be harder to move relative to each other than two pieces of fine sandpaper. But if two pieces of flat metal are made progressively smoother, you will reach a point where the resistance to relative movement increases. If you make them very flat and smooth, and remove all surface contaminants in a vacuum, the smooth flat surfaces will actually adhere to each other, making what is called a "cold weld".</p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="fricon.html">Friction concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="frict2.html#plo">Plot of standard model</a><BR><BR>Reference<br><a href="mecref.html#c1">Jones & Childers, 2nd Ed.</a><br>Sec 4.8</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="hph.html#mechcon">     Mechanics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="rou"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Friction and Surface Roughness</H1> <center><img src= "imgmec/frou.gif"></center><p>In general, the <a href="#coe">coefficients of friction</a> for <a href="frict2.html#sta">static</a> and <a href="frict2.html#kin">kinetic</a> friction are different.</p> <p>Like all simple statements about friction, this picture of friction is too simplistic. Saying that rougher surfaces experience more friction sounds safe enough - two pieces of coarse sandpaper will obviously be harder to move relative to each other than two pieces of fine sandpaper. But if two pieces of flat metal are made progressively smoother, you will reach a point where the resistance to relative movement increases. If you make them very flat and smooth, and remove all surface contaminants in a vacuum, the smooth flat surfaces will actually adhere to each other, making what is called a "cold weld". Once you reach a certain degree of mechanical smoothness, the frictional resistance is found to depend on the nature of the molecular forces in the area of contact, so that substances of comparable "smoothness" can have significantly different coefficients of friction.</p><p>An easily observed counterexample to the idea that rougher surfaces exhibit more friction is that of ground glass versus smooth glass. Smooth glass plates in contact exhibit much more frictional resistance to relative motion than the rougher ground glass.</p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="fricon.html">Friction concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="frict.html#coe">Coefficients of friction</a><BR><BR><a href="frict2.html#plo">Plot of friction force</a><BR><BR>Reference<br><a href="mecref.html#c1">Jones & Childers, 2nd Ed.</a><br>Sec 4.8</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="hph.html#mechcon">     Mechanics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="coe"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Coefficients of Friction</H1> <p><a href="#fri">Friction</a> is typically characterized by a coefficient of friction which is the ratio of the frictional resistance force to the <a href="#nor">normal force</a> which presses the surfaces together.
