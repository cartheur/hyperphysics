The metals which can accomplish this are sodium and lithium, with sodium being the most abundant and most commonly used. The construction of the fast breeder requires a higher <a href="ligwat.html#c2">enrichment</a> of U-235 than a light-water reactor, typically 15 to 30%. The reactor fuel is surrounded by a "blanket" of non-fissionable U-238. No moderator is used in the breeder reactor since fast neutrons are more efficient in <a href="#c2">transmuting</a> U-238 to Pu-239. At this concentration of U-235, the cross-section for fission with fast neutrons is sufficient to sustain the chain-reaction. Using water as coolant would slow down the neutrons, but the use of liquid sodium avoids that moderation and provides a very efficient heat transfer medium.   </p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><center><a href="reactor.html#c5"><img src="imgnuk/lmfbrt.gif"><br>Illustration</a></center></td><td><a href="#c5">Cool with liquid sodium?

That immediately raised the question of safety since sodium metal is an extremely reactive chemical and burns on contact with air or water (sometimes explosively on contact with water). It is true that the liquid sodium must be protected from contact with air or water at all times, kept in a sealed system. However, it has been found that the safety issues are not significantly greater than those with high-pressure water and steam in the <a href="ligwat.html#c1">light-water reactors</a>.</p>      <p>Sodium is a solid at room temperature but liquifies at 98&#176;C. It has a wide working temperature since it does not boil until 892&#176;C. That brackets the range of operating temperatures for the reactor so that it does not need to be pressurized as does a water-steam coolant system. It has a large <a href="../thermo/spht.html#c1">specific heat</a> so that it is an efficient heat-transfer fluid.  </p><p>In practice, those reactors which have used liquid metal coolants have been fast-neutron reactors. The liquid metal coolant has a major advantage there because water as a coolant also <a href="moder.html#c1">moderates</a> or slows down the neutrons. Such fast-neutron reactors require a higher degree of <a href="ligwat.html#c2">enrichment</a> of the uranium fuel than do the water moderated reactors.</p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="../tables/liqprop.html#c1">Properties of liquid sodium</a></td></tr></table></center><p>References:<br>Wiki:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_metal_cooled_reactor">Liquid-metal cooled reactors</a></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="fiscon.html#c1">Fission concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../nuccon.html#nuccon">     Nuclear </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c6"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>The Super-Phenix</H1> <p> The Super-Phenix was the first large-scale <a href="#c1">breeder reactor</a>.
