No new nuclear power plants have been ordered since the <a href="tmi-2.html#c1">Three Mile Island</a> accident, and some partially completed projects have been abandoned. As of 1990 about 20% of electricity in the U.S. was generated by nuclear plants, compared to about 75% in France.  </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="fiscon-2.html#c1">Fission concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../nuccon.html#nuccon">     Nuclear </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c2"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Reactor Accidents</H1><p> The nuclear accident at <a href="cherno-2.html#c1">Chernobyl</a> was the worst nuclear accident to date, spewing about 100 million Curies of radioactive material into the environment. By contrast, the accident at <a href="tmi-2.html#c1">Three Mile Island</a> released only some 15 Curies. Though its health effects were minimal, Three Mile Island did perhaps irreparable damage to the level of public confidence in nuclear reactors for electric power production in the United States.  </p>     <p> Preceding these two high-profile accidents are a number of nuclear accidents with radiation release. These include accidents at the <a href="nucacc-2.html#c1">Fermi I</a> reactor near Detroit, at the NRX reactor at <a href="nucacc-2.html#c2">Chalk River</a>, Canada, at the <a href="nucacc-2.html#c3">Windscale</a> reactor in England, and the SL-1 Reactor at <a href="nucacc-2.html#c4">Idaho Falls</a>. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="fiscon-2.html#c1">Fission concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../nuccon.html#nuccon">     Nuclear </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c3"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Radioactive Waste Disposal </H1><p>The <a href="fission-2.html#c2">nuclear fission</a> of uranium-235 produces large quantities of intermediate mass radioisotopes. The <a href="fisfrag-2.html#c1">mass distribution</a> of these radioisotopes peaks at about mass numbers 95 and 137 , and most of them are radioactive. The most dangerous for environmental release are probably <a href="fisfrag-2.html#c4">cesium</a> and <a href="fisfrag-2.html#c5">strontium</a> because of their intermediate half-lives and propensity for reconcentration in the food chain.</p>    <p> When spent fuel assemblies are removed from nuclear reactors, they are transported to "swimming pool" storage facilities to dissipate the heat of decay of short-lived isotopes as well as for isolation from the environment. The long term disposal of these wastes remains a major problem. It was assumed that these wastes would be encased in glass and placed in geologic disposal sites in underground salt domes. The site at Yucca Mountain was chosen as a first site, but both technical and political problems have thus far blocked its implementation.  </p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="#c4">Discussion</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="fiscon-2.html#c1">Fission concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../nuccon.html#nuccon">     Nuclear </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c4"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Nuclear Weapons Proliferation </H1><p>  One concern about nuclear reactors is that the fuel could be diverted for the production of nuclear weapons. While the the uranium fuel is <a href="ligwat-2.html#c2">enriched</a> to only 3-5% and could not easily be further separated to the >90% U-235 needed to produce a bomb, the spent fuel elements contain plutonium-239.
