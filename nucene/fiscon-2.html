This indicated that some of the U-235 had undergone spontaneous nuclear fission at some point in the past. Also, fission-produced isotopes of neodynium and samarium were found. Some samples were found with a U-235 concentration as low as 0.29%. Models of the process suggested sustained fission reactions over a period of about a million years during a time period about two billion years ago. </p><p> The age estimate from cores in the reactor zones suggest a time frame between 1.7 and 1.9 billion years ago. For U-235 (halflife 700 million years) and U-238 (halflife 4.5 billion years), this would give a concentration of about 3% for the U-235 at the time of the reaction.  It is presumed that ground water seeping through the ore served as a natural <a href="moder-2.html#c3">moderator</a> to slow down the <a href="u235chn-3.html#c1">fission neutrons</a>. One of the interesting observations was that the bulk of the fission products seemed to be still in place in their geologic depository after nearly 2 billion years. This could be taken as a suggestion that geologic storage of radioactive waste is feasible. </p>  </TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="fiscon-2.html#c1">Fission concepts</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="../nucref.html#c1">Cowan</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../nuccon.html#nuccon">     Nuclear </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
