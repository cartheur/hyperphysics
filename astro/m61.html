Visible in M61 are a host of features common to spiral galaxies: bright spiral arms, a central bar, dust lanes, and bright knots of stars. M61, also known as NGC 4303, in similar to our own <a href="galax.html#c1">Milky Way Galaxy</a>. M61 was discovered by telescope in 1779 twice on the same day, but one observer initially mistook the galaxy for a comet. Light from M61 takes about 60 million years to reach us. Recent observations of M61 have detected unpredicted high velocity gas moving in its halo.</p><p>M61 is one of the larger galaxies in the  Virgo cluster; its 6 arc minutes of diameter correspond to about 100,000 light years, similar to the diameter of the Milky Way galaxy. (SEDS) It is classified as a SABbc spiral galaxy.</p>Credit for image:Hillary Mathis, N.A.Sharp/NOAO/AURA/NSF .
