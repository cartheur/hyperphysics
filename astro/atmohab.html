This compares with about 0.1% in the Sun, the so-called "cosmic abundance". But having a lot of oxygen on a planet doesn't imply that there is an oxygen atmosphere. Oxygen tends to be bound in oxides so it would be quite possible to have almost no oxygen in the atmosphere.</p><p>The models that have been constructed for the oxygenation of the Earth's atmosphere make a very long story. Ward and Brownlee's version of this story involves what they call the "oxygen revolution". In their model, the formation of continents at about 2.5 billion years ago provided increased habitat for vast quantities of stromatolites that released oxygen into the sea. Up until about 1.8 billion years ago, that oxygen was bound to the dissolved iron in the oceans, as evidenced by the deposits of banded iron. But around 1.8 billion years ago, the free iron was bound and oxygen began to be released into the atmosphere. Prokaryotic bacteria (<a href="../biology/cyanobac.html#c1">cyanobacteria</a>), using only water, carbon dioxide and energy from sunlight continued to release quantities of oxygen into the atmosphere. This revolution provided the basis for the oxygen metabolism of the eukaryotic cell machinery and became the basis for building higher animal life. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="wcearth.html#c2">Habitable planet concepts</a><br><br><a href="astref.html#c1">Ward & Brownlee</a><br>Ch 5</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="astcon.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c3"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>The Amount of Carbon Needed for Life</H1><p>The unique chemistry of carbon is essential for life as we know it.
