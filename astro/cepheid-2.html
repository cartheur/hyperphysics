This makes them invaluable as a contributer to astronomical <a href="distance-2.html#c1">distance measurement</a>. The periods are very regular and range from 1 to 100 days. </p><center><img src="imgast/cephv-2.gif"></center><p>The shape of the Cephiad luminosity curve is often referred to as a "shark fin" shape when plotted as <a href="para-2.html#c5">magnitude</a> vs period. It should be noted that the smooth curve is an average behavior. There is considerable scatter about such a curve, at least in the observations. </p?<center><img src="imgast/maslumcep-2.gif"></center><p>The above period-luminosity curve plotted as a function of multiples of the Sun's luminosity (Bennett, et al.)  shows the kind of scatter in the dependence of absolute luminosity on period. A Cepheid variable nevertheless gives a good indication of distance when used as a <a href="stdcand-2.html#c1">standard candle</a>. The distances to 273 such Cepheid variables were measured directly by <a href="para-2.html#c1">stellar parallax</a> by the <a href="../solar/hipparcos.html#c2">Hipparcos</a> satellite.</p><p> There is some scatter in the measured luminosity as well. Consider a collection of data posted by the AAVSO from their international database:</p><center><img src="imgast/deltalc-2.gif"></center><p>This composite light curve is described as being composed of almost 750 observations from 35 observers. Despite the apparent scatter, the long term reproducibility of this pattern has led to a value of 5.366 days for the period of delta Cephei. Many Cepheids have periods that are known to the second according to AAVSO.</p><p>The Cepheid variables described above are from <a href="../starlog/pop12.html#c1">Population I</a> stars and are sometimes called Type I Cepheids. There is another class of variable star called a W. Virginis Cepheid which is about 4 times less luminous. They are from older, metal-poor star populations (Population II) and are sometimes called Type II Cepheids. </p><p>References:<p><a href="http://www.aavso.org/">http://www.aavso.org/ </a>   American Association of Variable Star Observers   home page.<br><a href="http://www.aavso.org/vstar/vsots/0900.shtml">http://www.aavso.org/vstar/vsots/0900.shtml  </a> Document celebrating delta Cephei as "Variable Star of the Month" in September 2000.</p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><h3><a href="#c3">Cepheid distance measurement</a></h3></td></tr></table></center><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="andromeda-2.html#c1">Andromeda distance</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="../starlog/starcon.html#c1">Star Concepts</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="astref-2.html#c1">Bennett, et al.<br>Ch. 19</a></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="astcon-2.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c3"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Cepheid Variable Distance</H1><p><a href="#c2">Cepheid variable</a> stars have proved to be one of the most valuable methods for distance determination because their period of variability has been shown to be related to their absolute luminosity by a <a href="#c2">period-luminosity relationship</a>.</p><center><img src="imgast/maslumcep-2.gif"></center><p> They can then be calibrated as <a href="stdcand-2.html#c1">standard candles</a> for distance calculation.
