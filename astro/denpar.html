Remarkably, study of the expansion rate has shown that the universe is very close to the critical density that would cause it to expand forever. It is customary to express the density as a fraction of the density required for the critical condition with the parameter &#937 = &#961/&#961<sub>critical</sub> so that &#937 = 1 represents the condition of critical density.  <table><tr><td>The expansion of the universe has been studied in a number of different ways, but the <a href="wmap.html#c1">WMAP</a> mission completed in 2003 represents a major step in precision and the results quoted here will be mainly those from WMAP.</td><td>                                                    <center><img src="imgast/wmapt.gif"></center></td></tr></table><center><img src="imgast/masden.gif"></center>It is common practice to give a subscript 0 to these quantities at the present time. <table BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><img src="imgast/omm.gif"></td><td>The mass density at the current time was assessed by WMAP to be &#937;<sub>m,0</sub> = 0.27 +/- 0.04. But the assessment of ordinary or baryonic matter was only 0.044 +/- 0.004, so baryonic matter constitutes ony 17% of the matter of the universe, the remainder being classified as "<a href="darmat.html#c1">dark matter</a>". </td></tr><tr><td><img src="imgast/omrel.gif"></td><td>The equivalent mass density of the <a href="engrad.html#c3">relativistic particles</a>, made up of <a href="engrad.html#c1">electromagnetic energy</a> and <a href="engrad.html#c2">neutrinos</a>, is assessed by WMAP to be &#937;<sub>rel,0</sub> = 8.24 x 10<sup>-5</sup>.

With 73% of the influence on the expansion of the universe in this era, the dark energy is viewed as the dominant influence on that expansion. The previous history of the big bang is viewed as being at first radiation dominated, then matter dominated, and now having passed into the era where dark energy is the dominant influence. </td></tr></table><p> The sum of the contributions to the total density paramater &#937;<sub>0</sub>at the current time is <center><font size=+2>&#937;<sub>0</sub> = 1.02 +/- 0.02</font></center>indicating that the universe is very close to critical density or &#937; =1.
