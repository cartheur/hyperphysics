This is interpreted as evidence of a core of iron and nickel, with Mars having a smaller core. Even the largest <a href="../solar/meteor.html#c1">meteorites</a> often show <a href="../solar/meteor2.html#c1">iron/nickel cores</a>, so that the iron core seems like a signature for the formation of massive objects in the inner part of the solar system.</p> <table><tr><td><center><img src="../solar/picsol/moonearthr.jpg"></center></td><td><p>  But Earth's <a href="../solar/earth.html#c2">Moon</a> with a density of 3.3 g/cm<sup>3</sup> is very different from the Earth and from the other bodies in the inner solar system. This was one of the first clues that the origin of the Moon was not just accretion from the same material from which the Earth was formed.  </p></td></tr></table><p>Using data on the <a href="../geophys/earthstruct.html#c1">structure of the Earth</a>, a simplified perspective can be constructed of the inner planets and Earth's Moon. The size of Earth's core is shown, and the planet densities above are used to construct similar images of the other inner planets. All except the Moon have sizable iron cores. The <a href="../solar/mars.html#c2">moons of Mars</a> are too small to show in this perspective. </p><center>Modeling the iron cores of the inner planets.</center><center><img src="astpic/planetcore.jpg"></center><p>By the time the Moon samples and extensive data from the <a href="../solar/apollo.html#c1">Apollo program</a> were analyzed, it was clear that the Moon had a hot, violent origin which left it without significant iron content. The process of modeling the process could begin. </p><center><img src = "imgast/moonhot.gif"></center><p>According to Ward and Brownlee, there is remarkable similarity between the trace element content of the Moon rocks and rocks from Earth's mantle. Also the isotopic content of the Earth and Moon samples was essentially identical.</p><table><tr><td><p>More than a decade was spent analyzing the rich body of information from the Apollo program, including many detailed studies of the surface rocks collected from the Moon. By the mid 1980's there were a number of advocates for an extraordinary and seemingly unlikely scenario for the formation of the Moon. The proposed formation process involves a  collision of the young Earth with a body with the mass of Mars or greater. At right is a series of sketches which qualitatively describe this scenario. These sketches follow Ward and Brownlee, who credit A. Cameron and R. M. Canup with computer simulations of this series of events. </p> <p>In view of the facts that the <a href="orbtilt.html#c1">tilt angle</a> of the Earth's spin axis is favorable to life, and that the mass of the large Moon is important in <a href="#c1">stabilizing that spin axis</a>, this proposal for the Moon's formation is remarkable indeed. "To produce such a massive moon, the impacting body had to be the right size, it had to impact the right point on Earth, and the impact had to have occurred at just the right time in the Earth's growth process."(Ward & Brownlee)</p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="#c3">Some history</a></td></tr></table></center></td><td><center><img src = "imgast/mooncollis.gif"></center></td></tr></table><h1>This hypothesis about the origin of the Moon is sometimes called "The Big Whack"</h1><p>According to Canup's simulations, most of the above series of steps would have been acomplished in a time period on the order of a day! She also projects that the Moon might have then formed from the debris in a period on the order of a hundred years. Since rock samples from the Moon have been dated as old as 4.4 billion years, the projected impact is placed in the first 100 million years or so of the Earth's formation. </p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="moonform.html#c1">Alternative hypotheses for Moon formation</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="wcearth.html#c2">Habitable planet concepts</a><br><br><a href="astref.html#c1">Ward & Brownlee</a><br>Ch 10<br><br><a href="astref.html#c1">Cameron & Canup</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="astcon.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c3"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Development of Lunar Origin Hypotheses</H1><p>Before the landing of Apollo 11 on the Moon in 1969, the most popular theory was the the Moon had formed cold and could be a Rosetta Stone for studying the origin of the solar system. The sheer volume of data and samples returned by the Apollo program occupied planetary scientists for over a decade. At a critical meeting on the origin of the Moon held in Kona, Hawaii in 1984 a new picture began to emerge, one involving a <a href="#c2">massive impact</a> early in the history of the Earth. A collection of papers from that meeting was published in a 1986 book edited by Hartmann, Phillips and Taylor who had been working on the impact hypothesis for some years. Hartmann had worked with Donald R. Davis on earlier models of this hypothesis. Cameron and Canup also worked on the impact hypothesis and did computer simulations of the process. Such modeling was the subject of Dr. Robin Canup's Ph.D. dissertation in the 1990's on the moon's origin and the giant impact hypothesis.</p>Some web references:<br><a href="http://www.psi.edu/projects/moon/moon.html">http://www.psi.edu/projects/moon/moon.html</a><br><a href="http://www.xtec.es/recursos/astronom/moon/camerone.htm">http://www.xtec.es/recursos/astronom/moon/camerone.htm</a><a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/solarsystem/moon_making_010815-1.html">http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/solarsystem/moon_making_010815-1.html</a></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="wcearth.html#c2">Habitable planet concepts</a><br><br><a href="astref.html#c1">Ward & Brownlee</a><br>Ch 10<br><br><a href="astref.html#c1">Cameron & Canup</a><br><br><a href="astref.html#c1">Hartmann, et al. </a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="astcon.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
