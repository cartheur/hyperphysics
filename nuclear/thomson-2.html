J. Thomson and the Electron</H1><p>Sir Joseph John Thomson (1856-1940) played a pivotal role in developing our understanding of the electron. In the 1890's, cathode ray tubes had been developed in which a luminous beam could be produced in a partially evacuated glass tube, directed from the negative electrode (cathode) to the positive (anode). A narrow luminous beam could be produced by using an aperture near the cathode, and this beam could be deflected by either an electric field or a magnetic field. Thomson showed that with the application of both electric and magnetic fields, he could balance the deflections and obtain a straight beam. This same principle is presently used in <a href="../magnetic/maspec.html#c3">velocity selectors</a> for <a href="../magnetic/maspec.html#c1">mass spectrometers</a>. Using this apparatus, Thomson determined the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron, e/m. </p><p>The determination of the charge of the electron awaited the work of <a href="millikan-2.html#c1">Millikan</a> who measured the electron charge in 1909 with his oil drop experiment. With the combined results of Thomson and Millikan, a value for the electron  mass was obtained - a value far below that of atoms. It was known that electrons could be removed from atoms, and that they became positive ions as a result. From the perception of solid matter, it was presumed that this positive residual matter filled the entire space of the atom, giving rise to what has been called the "<a href="rutsca3-2.html#c2">Thomson model</a>" of the atom. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../nuccon.html#nuccon">     Nuclear </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
