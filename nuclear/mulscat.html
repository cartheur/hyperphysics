<HEAD>   <TITLE>Multiple Scattering in Rutherford Experiments</TITLE></HEAD><body bgcolor="#FFE4C8"><!-- Copyright 2003 by Carl Rod Nave, RodNave@gsu.edu--><A Name="c1"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Multiple Scattering</H1><p>In <a href="../rutsca.html#c1">Rutherford scattering</a> experiments, a metal foil of finite thickness is bombarded by <a href="radact.html#c2">alpha particles</a>. At what thickness of foil do you have to worry about multiple scattering? Some simple calculations will be explored here to suggest that with the gold foil thicknesses around 1 micrometer in the historical experiments, there was very little multiple scattering. Using the concept of <a href="crosec.html#c1">cross section</a>, the fraction of the particles scattered can be taken to be the effective area of the scatterer compared to the total area.  </p><p>Gold, for example, has a nuclear radius about 7 fermis and an atomic radius of about 0.13 nm. The geometrical cross section of the nucleus is about 154 fm<sup>2</sup> or 1.54 barns. The cross sectional area of the atom is then about 3.45 x 10<sup>8</sup> times the area of the nucleus. You would then expect that if you fired a neutron into a gold atom, the probability of hitting the nucleus would be about one in 345 million!</p><p>One simple approach to estimating the probability for multiple scattering it to suggest that for a given scattered particle, the remaining targets would have to cover 1% of the area for you to  have a 1% probability of a second scattering event. Using the area ratio, you would project 3.45 x 10<sup>6</sup> layers of atoms to cover 1% of the area with nuclei, assuming a random distribution. At a nominal distance between layers equal to the atomic diameter, this projects to about 900 micrometers in thickness. </p><p>For alpha particle scattering, the cross section is much larger than the geometric cross section because of the Coulomb force. For 6 MeV alpha particles, the cross section calculation for scattering above 30&#176; gives 15730 fm<sup>2</sup> = 157.3 barns. The ratio of atomic area to this area is about 3.38 x 10<sup>6</sup>. Using the same simple approach, it would take about 3.38 x 10<sup>4</sup> atomic layers to scatter 1%, which projects to a thickness of about 9 micrometers. </p><p>This simple approach suggests that the 1 micrometer thickness of the gold foils used in Rutherford experiments was thin enough to minimize concern about multiple scattering.</p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href= "crosec2.html#c1">Numerical example: gold foil</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a  href="../rutcon.html#c1">Rutherford concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../nuccon.html#c1">     Nuclear </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
