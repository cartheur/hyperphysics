This can be said without specifying the conditions under which you keep the sample, because you can't change it by heating it, by striking it with lightning, by combining it into a molecule, or any other environmental interaction short of a direct nuclear impact by a high speed particle.</p><table><tr><td><img src="imgnuc/decayr-2.gif"></td><td><p>The time for a given nucleus to decay is unpredictable and random, but the rate of decay of a sample is <u>not</u> random but dependent upon nuclear structure details through the <a href="halfli2-2.html#c4">decay constant</a>. A sizable sample will have a significant fraction of <a href="../kinetic/idegas.html#c4">Avogadro's number</a> of nuclei, and the statistics of such a decay are such that it follows a precise exponential decay pattern. </p></td></tr></table><table><tr><td><p>The <a href="alptun.html#c1">range of half-lives</a> of heavy elements that emit alpha particles varies over 20 orders of magnitude, from about a tenth of a microsecond to 10 billion years. But they all follow exactly the same form of decay, an exponential decay determined by nuclear structure parameters. </p></td><td><img src="imgnuc/alplot.gif"></td></tr></table><p> The <a href="radser-2.html#c1">natural radioactive series</a> found on the Earth involve multiple steps, each step with its characteristic "parent" and "daughter" products. Because the radioactive <a href="halfli-2.html#c1">half-life</a> of a given radioisotope is not affected by temperature, physical or chemical state, or any other influence of the environment outside the nucleus save direct particle interactions with the nucleus, then <a href="radact-2.html#c1">radioactive</a> samples continue to decay at a predictable rate. If determinations or reasonable estimates of the original composition of a radioactive sample can be made, then the amounts of the radioisotopes present can provide a measurement of the time elapsed. </p>    <p>One such method is called <a href="cardat-2.html#c1">carbon dating</a>, which is limited to the dating of organic (once living) materials. For longer time scales appropriate for geologic samples, the <a href="clkroc-2.html#c4">Rubidium-Strontium</a> method is an example of a nuclear clock. </p><center><img src="imgnuc/rockline2-2.gif"></center><p>The longer-lived radioisotopes in minerals provide evidence of long time scales in geological processes. While original compositions cannot be determined with certainty, various combination measurements provide self-consistent values for the the times of formations of certain geologic deposits.
