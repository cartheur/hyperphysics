Levin</p><p>Krane points out that future carbon dating will not be so reliable because of changes in the carbon isotopic mix. Fossil fuels have no carbon-14 content, and the burning of those fuels over the past 100 years has diluted the carbon-14 content. On the other hand, atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons in the 1950s and 1960s increased the carbon-14 content of the atmosphere. Krane suggests that this might have doubled the concentration compared to the carbon-14 from cosmic ray production. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="../nucref.html#c1">Krane</a><br>Sec 6.7</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../nuccon.html#nuccon">     Nuclear </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c5"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Accelerator Techniques for Carbon Dating</H1> <p>Accelerator techniques for <a href="#c2">carbon dating</a> have extended its range back to about 100,000 years, compared to less than half that for direct counting techniques. One can count atoms of different masses with a <a href="../magnetic/maspec.html#c1">mass spectrometer</a>, but that is problematic for carbon dating because of the low concentration of carbon-14 and the existence of nitrogen-14 and CH<sub>2</sub> which have essentially the same mass. Cyclotrons and tandem accelerators have both been used to fashion sensitive new mass spectrometer analyses. The tandem accelerator has been effective in removing the nitrogen-14 and CH<sub>2</sub>, and can be followed by a conventional mass spectrometer to separate the C-12 and C-13. A sensitivity of 10<sup>-15</sup> in the <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratio has been achieved. These techniques can be applied with a sample as small as a milligram. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="../nucref.html#c1">Krane</a><br>Sec 20.2</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../nuccon.html#nuccon">     Nuclear </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
