<HEAD>   <TITLE>Notation for nuclear energy states</TITLE></HEAD><body bgcolor="#FFE4C8"><!-- Copyright 2001 by Carl Rod Nave, RodNave@gsu.edu--><A Name="c1"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Notation for nuclear energy states</H1><p>Somewhat parallel to the labeling of atomic energy states, the labels of nuclear states are determined by their angular momenta. For single particle states you know that the spin part is S=1/2 and then the orbital angular momentum is used to determine a letter designation according to the <a href="../quantum/hydcol.html#c3">spectroscopic notation</a>. If L=2, then the state is represented by "d" and then the total angular momentum could be either L-S=3/2 or L+S=5/2. The two states would then be labeled: </p><center><p><font size=+2> 1d<sub>3/2</sub> and 1d<sub>5/2</sub></font></center><p>The number n preceding the letter designation is analogous to the principal quantum number in the hydrogen atom in that it indicates the order of the energy states. But this number n is not subject to the same limitations as in the atomic case - it is just an indexing parameter. So the lowest energies with L=2 are labeled 1d (1d<sub>3/2</sub>,1d<sub>5/2</sub>), but there are  higher levels with L=2 with would be labeled 2d<sub>3/2</sub>,2d<sub>5/2</sub>,3d<sub>3/2</sub>,3d<sub>5/2</sub>, etc.</p><p>For light nuclei it is presumed that the nucleons will fill levels according to the sequence of the <a href="shell.html#c1b">shell model</a>. Those nucleons in closed shells will be presumed not to contribute to the total nuclear spin, so the configuration of the nucleus will be indicated by the symbols for the nucleons outside closed shells. For example, <sup>17</sup>O has one neutron outside a closed shell (Z=N=8= <a href="shell.html#c2">magic number</a>) and its ground state would be designated (1d<sub>5/2</sub>)<sup>1</sup>.</p><center><P><font size=+1><sup>17</sup>O:   [(1s<sub>1/2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>(1p<sub>3/2</sub>)<sup>4</sup>(1p<sub>1/2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>].......(1d<sub>5/2</sub>)<sup>1</sup></font><br>Closed shell plus one odd neutron</p></center><A Name="c1b"></A><p>The <a href="../quantum/parity.html#c1">parity</a> of the nuclear state is also an important characteristic and often listed as a part of the notation for the state. By correlation with the single particle shell model, a value of L can be associated with a given odd nucleon, and the parity of the state is (-1)<sup>L</sup>. For the <sup>17</sup>O case, the associated L is 2 (d state), so the parity can be predicted to be even. For <sup>15</sup>O, the odd neutron is in a p state (L=1) so the parity of that state is odd. The state of the <sup>15</sup>O is sometimes written as 1p<sub>1/2</sub><sup>-</sup> and that of <sup>17</sup>O  as 1d<sub>5/2</sub><sup>+</sup> to indicate both the spin and parity of those nuclei in their ground states. The parity, like the nuclear spin, is taken to be a characteristic of the entire nucleus, but the parity would be even for closed shells so it is usually sufficient to consider the parity of the odd nucleon. </p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="#c2">"Magic numbers" of nucleons</a></td><td><a href="#c3">Nuclear potential wells</a></td><td><a href="nucspec.html#c1">Nuclear spectra</a></td></tr></table></center><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="sphwel.html#c1">Spherical potential well</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="nucstructcon.html#c1">Nuclear Structure Concepts</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="../nucref.html#c1">Rohlf</a><br>Sec 11.3</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../nuccon.html#nuccon">     Nuclear </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
