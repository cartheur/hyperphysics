The isotope <sup>87</sup>Rb decays into the ground state of <sup>87</sup>Sr with a half-life of 4.7 x 10<sup>10</sup> years and a maximum <font face="symbol">b</font><sup>-</sup> energy of 272 keV. <sup>86</sup>Sr is of non-radiogenic origin and can be used as a reference concentration to imply the original concentration of <sup>87</sup>Sr. </p><p>From an example by Jelley, the following five chondritic meteorites are reported to have the following proportions of the  rubidium and strontium isotopes:</p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td>Meteorites</td><td><center><sup>87</sup>Rb/<sup>86</sup>Sr</center></td><td><center><sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr</center></td></tr><tr><td>Modoc</td><td><center>0.86</sup>Sr</center></td><td><center>0.757</center></td></tr><tr><td>Homestead</td><td><center>0.8</sup>Sr</center></td><td><center>0.751</center></td></tr><tr><td>Bruderheim</td><td><center>0.72</sup>Sr</center></td><td><center>0.747</center></td></tr><tr><td>Kyushu</td><td><center>0.6</sup>Sr</center></td><td><center>0.739</center></td></tr><tr><td>Buth Furnace</td><td><center>0.09</sup>Sr</center></td><td><center>0.706</center></td></tr></table></center><p>This data was plotted with the spreadsheet Excel as shown below.</p><center><img src="imgnuc/rbsrmet.gif"></center><p>The age consistent with the slope of this plot can be calculated in a way which makes use of the non-radiogenic <sup>86</sup>Sr as a reference. The slope obtained was m=0.0676, using the <a href="../dist.html#c2">point-slope form</a> of a line, y = mx + b, and the corresponding age is 4.6 x 10<sup>9</sup> years. The intercept b = 0.70 suggests that these values for isotopic abundances are consistent with an original strontium isotope ratio <sup>87</sup>Sr/ <sup>86</sup>Sr = 0.7 . </p><p>While the consistency is remarkable, there are uncertainties. A glance at the plot above shows that the Homestead meteorite is a bit off the line with the others. In fact, if just an average of the point-to-point slopes for all the data points is used, including the Homestead meteorite, an age of 4.7 billion is obtained, showing that there is a significant uncertainty in the dates obtained. The 4.6 billion year value was obtained by eliminating the Homestead meteorite, since that appeared to give a more consistent slope for the curve. This is all the data I have about these particular samples - comments about this scenario are invited. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="../nucref.html#c1">Jelley</a><br>Sec 3.8<a href</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../nuccon.html#nuccon">     Nuclear </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
