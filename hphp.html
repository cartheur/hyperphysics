For the most part, it is laid out in small segments or "cards", true to its original development in HyperCard. The entire environment is interconnected with thousands of links, reminiscent of a neural network. The bottom bar of each card contains links to major concept maps for divisions of physics, plus a "go back" feature to allow you to retrace the path of an exploration. The side bar contains a link to the extensive Index, which itself is composed of active links. That sidebar also contains links to relevant concept maps. The rationale for such concept maps is to provide a visual survey of conceptually connected material, and it is hoped that they will provide some answers to the question "where do I go from here?". Whether you need further explanation of concepts which underly the current card content, or are seeking applications which go beyond it, the concept map may help you find the desired information. </p><p>Part of the intent for this exploration environment is to provide many opportunities for numerical exploration in the form of active formuli and standard problems implemented in Javascript. An active exploration in physics will typically lead you to something which needs to be quantified, and it is hoped that the many Javascript-enabled calculations will provide many opportunities to answer "What if .." type questions.</p> <p> New content for HyperPhysics will be posted as it is developed. The intent is to maintain the entire HyperPhysics project on the Web with stable locations so that links to it may be established with confidence that they will be there for an extended period of time. As the basic phase nears completion, the author is interested in extensions to specific applied areas. If you are interested in developing specific material for a specialized course, you might consider building it upon this framework with links to HyperPhysics to provide the basic conceptual background. The entire HyperPhysics project can be made available on a cross-platform CD ROM since it will remain compatible with the standard web browsers.</p><H1 align=center>Who is using HyperPhysics?</H1><p><font size="+1">A resource that was initiated as a resource for local high school physics teachers whom I had taught has expanded into an intensively used website worldwide.</font></p><a name="hph2"></a><center><img src="../papers/worldredlab.gif" ></center><p><font size="+1">CD versions have been sent to 71 countries to date, and translations into German and Italian have been licensed and are underway.</font></p><table><tr><td><table BORDER="1"><tr><td><font size=+3>Call for Translators</font></td></tr></table><center><table BORDER="1"><tr><td><a href="http://hep.phys.sfu.ca/d0/zyliu.page/hp_cn/index_trans.html">Chinese</a></td></tr></table></center></td><td><p>This is an offer to post translated versions of HyperPhysics for free access worldwide, just as the English version is offered. If you wish to translate parts of HyperPhysics for the use of your students, we will post a full mirror version of HyperPhysics dedicated to your language with all links so that your translated portions will have full access to the links to all of HyperPhysics. It is suggested that just the displayed text be translated, leaving all the links intact, therby reducing the labor of translation. While the Copyright of HyperPhysics must remain with the project, our commitment is to provide you with a CD version of the full HyperPhysics website with a license for a closed mirror (at least password protected) at your institution so that you can make full use of your translation efforts for teaching at your institution, even during the early stages of translation. When a large portion has been translated, a more flexible license will be provided to make sure you are not hindered from making use of your own work of translation. </td></tr></table><table><tr><td><center><img src="../papers/growthgraph2.gif" ></center></td><td><font size="+1"><p>The hit rate reached about 50 million file hits per year in the fifth year and logging was suspended.

One provision of this offering is that it must not be opened to the world wide web from your computer acting as a server. Mirror sites to the web are prohibited. Providing it to the web from just one main server is important for error checking in the development process.</p><p> The understanding upon distribution is that if you contributesignificant content to be added to the material (e.g., text, graphics, images, etc.)and it is incorporated into HyperPhysics, your contribution will be acknowledgedon the added material and you will be sent the next revision of the CD ROMfree of charge as compensation. </P><P>While copying and modifying the material for personal use or class presentation use is permitted under the terms of thisoffering, all rights to the material are reserved and no part of the material may be reproduced for any commercial purpose. Arrangements for distribution to students for a fee to cover costs may be made with the author. The intent of the offering is the enhancement of physics and astronomy teaching, and uses of the material which are strictly educational will be quickly agreed to without additional charges.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>NASA images and other public domain images included were downloaded fromthe Internet and may be freely used.
