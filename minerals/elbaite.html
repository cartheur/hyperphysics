This sample is from Brazil and is described as elbaite with <a href="albite-2.html#c1">albite</a>.  It is a <a href="../geophys/silicate.html#c1">silicate</a> which has <a href="../pertab/li.html#c2">lithium</a> content, lithium being a rather rare element. It also contains <a href="../pertab/B-2.html#c2">boron</a> This sample is about 10cm across.   </p><p>Elbaite is named after the area of the Island of Elba, Italy.</p></td></tr></table><center><img src="imgmin2/379elbaite.jpg"></center><p>This magnificent sample of elbaite with albite and quartz is from the Tourmaline Queen mine, San Diego County, California. It is about 25 cm wide. As the elbaite crystals grew, the growth solution changed from manganese-rich to iron-rich, creating a blue top on each "candle" (This sample is nicknamed "Candelabra"). </p><table><tr><td><p>At right is elbaite with albite from Golconda mine, Governador Valadares, Minas Gerais, Brazil.
