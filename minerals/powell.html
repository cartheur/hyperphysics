They were pencil-shading some pictures to get a feel for what the children of Colonial times might have done in the absence of color crayons. The pencil art above the fireplace was an example. </p> </td><td><center><img src="imgsum/9535girlstab.html"></center></td></tr></table><table><tr><td><center><img src="imgsum/9549jorelyfplace.html"></center> </td><td><p>Jordan and Elyse play with Colonial era dolls and accessories.
