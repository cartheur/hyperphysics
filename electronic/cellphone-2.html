This is described as being 45 MHz below the base frequencies assigned by the FCC, implying that a 45 MHz <a href="../sound/beat.html#c2">beat frequency</a> is used in the detection scheme. Communication on a cell telephone involves two frequencies, one for transmission and another slightly different for receiving, an arrangement referred to as "full duplex" transmission. This permits simultaneous input and output signals. In a given city it is typical to have 832 frequencies, representing 395 full duplex voice channels and 42 control channels. Each "cell" of base towers has 56 voice channels, or 1/7 of the total, with the distribution arranged on a hexagonal grid. The channels are 30 kHz apart. Early cell phones transmitted the signal by <a href="../audio/bcast.html#c6">frequency modulation</a>, but the technology is rapidly moving toward digital sound imaging.  </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66"><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="etroncon-2.html#c1">Electronics concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<a href= "../emcon.html#c1">Electricity and magnetism</a></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
