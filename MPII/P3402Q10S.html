Given sodium ionization energy of 5.1 eV and chlorine electron affinity<BR>of 3.6 eV, calculate the bond length. Given a measured dissociationenergy of 3.6 eV.<BR>The approach is ionization energy - electron affinity -ke^2/r = -3.6eV<BR>ke^2 = 1.44 eV nm, so r is given by<BR>r = 1.44/(5.1 -3.6 +3.6) =&nbsp; 0.282352941 nm<P>2. Given a j=0-1 transition frequency of 1.31E10, calculate bond lengthof NaCl.<BR>The masses of Na and Cl are 23 and 34.97 respectively.<BR>The reduced mass is&nbsp;&nbsp; 13.87459031 amu = 2.30318E-26 kg<BR>Using amu = 1.66E-27 kg<BR>The transition energy is hbar^2/moment of inertia = h*frequency =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.67954E-24 joule<BR>Using h= 6.6256E-34 J s<BR>The momentu of inertia is then = I =&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.28113E-45 kg m^2<BR>Using hbar=&nbsp; 1.0545E-34 J s<BR>The bond length can then be calculated from sqrt(moment of inertia/reducedmass) =<BR>r = sqrt(1.2811E-45/2.303E-26) m =&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.35855E-10 m = 0.235854706nm<P>3. From the vibrational frequency 3E13 Hz, calculate the bond forceconstant of NaCl<BR>The vibrational angular frequency is equal to sqrt(k/m) where in thiscase<BR>the m is the reduced mass calculated above.<BR>The bond force constant is then equal to (f*2*pi)^2 * m =<BR>For frequency 3.00E+13 Hz<BR>k= (3e13*2*pi())^2*2.303E-26 =&nbsp;&nbsp; 818.2691617 N/m<P>Hanging a 1 kg mass on such a spring would stretch it 9.8 N/818 N/m=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.011976499 m<BR>So a hanging kilogram would stretch this spring only 1.2 cm.</BODY>
