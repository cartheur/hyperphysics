You should be able to unscrew one without affecting the other. But that presumes an ideal voltage source, and any real battery has some internal resistance which must be taken into account. </p><image><img src="elepic/42boardlab.jpg"></center><p>Making measurements of the external voltage of the battery pair and the current flow for an open circuit, with one bulb, and with two bulbs provides the data for analyzing the observed behavior. Applying <a href="ohmlaw.html#c1">Ohm's law</a> and the <a href="elepow.html#c1">power relationship</a> allows us to determine the internal resistance of the battery and the power used in the bulbs. </p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2"CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="dcex.html#c1">DC circuit examples</a></td><td><a href="resis.html#c3">Resistor combinations</a></td></tr></table></center><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2"CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="batbulb2.html#c1">Bulbs in series and parallel</a></td></tr></table></center><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2"CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="battery.html#c1">Batteries</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html#hph">HyperPhysics</A>*****<a href= "../emcon.html#c1">Electricity and magnetism</a></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
