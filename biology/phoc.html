In the first step of the cycle CO<sub>2</sub> reacts with <a href = "../organic/rubisco.html#c2">RuBP</a> to produce two 3-carbon molecules of 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3-PGA). This is the origin of the designation C3 or C<sub>3</sub> in the literature for the cycle and for the plants that use this cycle. </p><center><img src="imgbio/c3cycle.gif"></center><p>The entire process, from light energy capture to sugar production occurs within the <a href="chloroplast.html#c1">chloroplast</a>. The light energy is captured by the <a href="etnoncyc.html#c1">non-cyclic electron transport</a> process which uses the thylakoid membranes for the required <a href="psetran.html#c1">electron transport</a>. </p><p>About 85% of plant species are C3 plants. They include the cereal grains: wheat, rice, barley, oats. Peanuts, cotton, sugar beets, tobacco, spinach, soybeans, and most trees are C3 plants. Most lawn grasses such as rye and fescue are C3 plants. </p><p>C3 plants have the disadvantage that in hot dry conditions their photosynthetic efficiency suffers because of a process called <a href="#c5">photorespiration</a>. When the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the <a href="chloroplast.html#c1">chloroplasts</a> drops  below about 50 ppm, the catalyst <a href="../organic/rubisco.html#c1">rubisco</a> that helps to fix carbon begins to fix oxygen instead. This is highly wasteful of the energy that has been collected from the light, and causes the rubisco to operate at perhaps a quarter of its maximal rate. </p><p>The problem of photorespiration is overcome in <a href="#c2">C4 plants</a> by a two-stage strategy that keeps CO<sub>2</sub> high and oxygen low in the chloroplast where the Calvin cycle operates. The class of plants called <a href="#c3">C3-C4 intermediates</a> and the <a href="#c4">CAM plants</a> also have better strategies than C3 plants for the avoidance of photorespiration. </p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="enercyc.html#c1">Energy cycle in living things</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br> <a href="psyncon.html#c1">Photosynthesis Concepts</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="bioref.html#c1">Moore, et al. </a><br>Ch 7</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="biocon.html#c1">     Biology </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c2"></A><TABLE WIDTH="666" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="600" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>C4 Photosynthesis</H1><table><tr><td><p>Sugarcane is a champion at photosynthesis under the right conditions and is a prime example of a C4 plant, one which uses C4 photosynthesis.

They use a two-stage process were CO<sub>2</sub> is fixed in thin-walled mesophyll cells to form a 4-carbon intermediate, typically malate (malic acid). The reaction involves phosphoenol pyruvate (<a href="../organic/pep.html#c1">PEP</a>) which fixes CO</sub>2</sub> in a reaction catalyzed by PEP-carboxylate. It forms oxaloacetic acid (OAA) which is quickly converted to malic acid.  The 4-carbon acid is actively pumped across the cell membrane into a thick-walled bundle sheath cell where it is split to CO<sub>2</sub> and a 3-carbon compound. </p><p>This CO<sub>2</sub> then enters the <a href="calvin.html#c1">Calvin cycle</a> in a <a href="chloroplast.html#c1">chloroplast</a> of the bundle sheath cell and produces G3P and subsequently sucrose, starch and other carbohydrates that enter the cells <a href="plaene.html#c1">energy transport</a> system. </p><center><img src="imgbio/kranzm.gif"></center><p>The advantage that comes from this two-stage process is that the active pumping of carbon into the bundle sheath cell and the blocking of oxygen produce an environment with 10-120x as much CO<sub>2</sub> available to the Calvin cycle and the <a href="../organic/rubisco.html#c1">rubisco</a> tends to be  optimally utilized. The high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and the absence of oxygen implies that the system never experiences the detractive effects of <a href="#c5">photorespiration</a>.</p><p>The drawback to C4 photosynthesis is the extra energy in the form of <a href="atp.html#c1">ATP</a> that is used to pump the 4-carbon acids to the bundle sheath cell and the pumping of the 3-carbon compound back to the mesophyll cell for conversion to PEP. This loss to the system is why C3 plants will outperform C4 plants if there is a lot of water and sun. The C4 plants make some of that energy back in the fact that the rubisco is optimally used and the plant has to spend less energy synthesizing rubisco.  </p><p>Moore, et al. say that only about 0.4% of the 260,000 known species of plants are C4 plants. But that small percentage includes the important food crops corn, sorghum, sugarcane and millet. Also inluded are crabgrass and bermuda. Many tropical grasses and sedges are C4 plants. </p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="enercyc.html#c1">Energy cycle in living things</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br> <a href="psyncon.html#c1">Photosynthesis Concepts</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="bioref.html#c1">Moore, et al. </a><br>Ch 7</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="biocon.html#c1">     Biology </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c3"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>C3-C4 Intermediate Photosynthesis</H1><p>Moore, et al. point to Flaveria (Asteraceae), Panicum (Poaceae) and Alternanthera (Amarantheceae) as genera that contain species that are intermediates between C3 and C4 photosynthesis. These plants have intermediate leaf anatomies that contain bundle sheath cells that are less distinct and developed than the <a href="#c2">C4 plants</a>.</p><table><tr><td><p>These intermediates are characterized by their resistance to <a href="#c5">photorespiration</a> so that they can operate in higher temperatures and dryer environments than <a href="#c1">C3 plants</a>.

If the CO<sub>2</sub> compensation point is lower on the above scale, the plant can operate in hotter and dryer conditions. The limits are placed by the fact that  <a href="../organic/rubisco.html#c1">rubisco</a> begins to fix oxygen rather than CO<sub>2</sub>, undoing the work of photosynthesis.

It could drop the pH to 4 with a malic acid concentration up to 0.3M . Then in the heat of the day, the stomata close tightly to conserve water and the malic acid is decarboxylated to release the CO<sub>2</sub> for fixing by the Calvin cycle.

In <a href="celres.html#c1">cellular respiration</a> it is a positive term, a process vital to life. But photorespiration is an entirely negative term because it represents a severe loss to the process of using light energy in photosynthetic organisms to fix carbon for subsequent carbohydrate synthesis. By leading to the loss of up to half of the carbon that has been fixed at the expense of light energy, photorespiration undoes the work of photosynthesis.</p><p>Photorespiration happens in <a href="#c1">C3 plants</a> when the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drops to about 50 ppm. The key enzyme that accomplishes the fixing of carbon is  <a href="../organic/rubisco.html#c1">rubisco</a>, and at low concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> it begins to fix oxygen instead. </p><center><img src="imgbio/photoresp.gif"></center><p>Under moderate temperature conditions when C3 plants have sufficient water, the supply of carbon dioxide is abundant and photorespiration is not a problem. The   CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of the atmosphere as of 2004 was about 38,000 ppm and this CO<sub>2</sub> freely diffuses through the stomata of leaves and across the membranes of the <a href="chloroplast.html#c1">chloroplasts</a> while water diffuses out through the stomata. But during hot and dry conditions, the stomata close to prevent excessive water loss and the continuing fixation of carbon in the <a href="calvin.html#c1">Calvin cycle</a> dramatically reduces the relative concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>. When it reaches a critical level of about 50 ppm the rubisco stops fixing CO<sub>2</sub> and begins to fix O<sub>2</sub> instead. Even though the detoured process feeds some PGA back into the cycle, the photorespiration process causes rubisco to operate at only about 25% of its optimal rate. </p><p>The <a href="#c2">C4 plants</a> and <a href="#c4">CAM plants</a> avoid photorespiration and therefore operate at much higher efficiencies in hot and dry climates.</p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorespiration">Photorespiration wiki</a></td></tr></table></center><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="../organic/carbonres.html#c1">Earth's carbon resources</a></td></tr></table></center><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="enercyc.html#c1">Energy cycle in living things</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br> <a href="psyncon.html#c1">Photosynthesis Concepts</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="bioref.html#c1">Moore, et al. </a><br>Ch 7</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="biocon.html#c1">     Biology </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
