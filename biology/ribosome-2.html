The ribosome accomplishes the reading of the <a href="../organic/mrna.html#c1">messenger RNAs</a> and the binding of <a href="../organic/amino.html#c1">amino acids</a> to the <a href="../organic/trna.html#c1">transfer RNAs</a> to build up the protein structures. This process is called <a href="../organic/translation.html#c1">translation</a>, a word that seems appropriate since it translates the four-character alphabet of the <a href="../organic/base.html#c1">bases</a> used in the <a href="../organic/gencode.html#c1">genetic code</a> to proteins built in the twenty-character alphabet of amino acids.   </p><p>The ribosome is a complex of over 50 proteins plus its own complement of RNA, often denoted rRNA. </p><p>There are free ribosomes that are suspended in the cytoplasm of the cell, but many of them are attached to the <a href="endret-2.html#c1">rough endoplasmic reticulum</a> associated with the nuclear envelope of the cell.</p><p> "If genomic DNA is the cell's planning authority, then the ribosome is its factory, churning out the proteins of life. It's a huge complex of protein and RNA with a practical and life-affirming purpose - catalyzing protein synthesis. Bacterial cells typically contain tens of thousands of ribosomes, and eukaryotic cells can contain hundreds of thousands or even a few  million of them" (Borman)</TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="bioref-2.html#c1">Hickman, et al.</a><br> Ch 4<br><br><a href="bioref-2.html#c1">Borman, Stu</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="biocon-2.html#heacon">   Biology </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
