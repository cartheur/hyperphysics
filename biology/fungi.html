They are distinct in their method of obtaining nutrition, secreting enzymes that digest food outside their bodies. There are fungi that can use essentially any biological material, so they exist essentially anywhere that any other life exists. Their reproduction is quite different from the most common type of cellular reproduction. They produce no embryos, but reproduce by means of tiny reproductive packages called spores. These spores are extraordinarily light and  mobile and are propagated widely by air currents and by attachment to any mobile object.  </p><center><img src="biopic/cavmushf.jpg"></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="bioref.html#c1">Audesirk & Audesirk</a><br> Ch 20</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="biocon.html#heacon">   Biology </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
