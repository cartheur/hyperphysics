The cells are very small, roughly the size of an animal <a href="mitochondria.html#c1">mitochondrion</a> (about 1-2&#956;m in diameter and 10 &#956;m long). Bacteria commonly occur in three major shapes: rod shaped, spherical, and spiral. Instead of going through elaborate replication processes like <a href="cell.html#c3">eukaryotes</a>, bacterial cells divide by binary fission.</p><p>This general description of bacterial function was accessed at <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/C004535/prokaryotic_cells.html">Thinkquest</a> :"Bacteria perform many important functions on earth. They serve as decomposers, agents of fermentation, and play an important role in our own digestive system. Also, bacteria are involved in many nutrient cycles such as the nitrogen cycle, which restores nitrate into the soil for plants. Unlike eukaryotic cells that depend on oxygen for their metabolism, prokaryotic cells enjoy a diverse array of metabolic functions. For example, some bacteria use sulfur instead of oxygen in their metabolism."</p><p>Bacteria are incredibly varied, and incredibly abundant. To give some kind of organization to the multitude, bacteria are typically divided into four phyla: the cyanobacteria, spirochetes, gram-positive bacteria, and proteobacteria. </p><p><b><a href="cyanobac.html#c1">Cyanobacteria</a></b> are photosynthetic, like plants, which means that they use the sun’s energy to make food for themselves. </p><p><b>Spirochetes</b> are <a href="grambac.html#c1">gram-negative</a> , spiral-shaped, and <a href="autotroph.html#c1">heterotrophic</a>. Some of them live in the presence of oxygen, others don’t. They may be parasitic, living symbiotically (where two organisms live off each other), or free-living. One type of spirochete causes syphilis.</p><p><b><a href="grambac.html#c1">Gram-positive bacteria</a></b> are not all gram-positive, despite the same. They are grouped together due to other similarities. This phylum includes the strain of streptococcus bacteria that causes strep throat. It also includes the bacteria that produces yogurt, by growing and fermenting in milk (producing lactic acid). These bacteria also produce many of our antibiotics.</p><p><b>Proteobacteria</b> is one of the largest phyla of all the bacteria. Many are <a href="grambac.html#c1">gram-negative</a>. They are divided into several subgroups, such as enteric bacteria, chemoautotrophs, and nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The enteric bacteria live mainly in intestinal tracts, like E. Coli. The chemoautotrophs oxidize chemicals in minerals to obtain energy. The nitrogen-fixing bacteria are essential to many ecosystems – one type converts the unusable nitrogen in the atmosphere to ammonia, the form plants can use most easily.</p><p>This material on bacteria was largely taken from <a href="http://co.essortment.com/archaebacteriae_rmkr.htm">essortment</a>)</p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="bioref.html#c1">Audesirk & Audesirk</a><br> Ch 4<br><br>Reference<br><a href="bioref.html#c1">Hickman, Roberts, Larson</a><br></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="biocon.html#heacon">   Biology </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c4"></A><TABLE WIDTH="666" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="600" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Archaebacteria</H1><p>Archaebacteria suggests "ancient bacteria", but they are considered distinct from ordinary <a href="#c3">bacteria</a> which are labeled with the domain name eubacteria. The archaebacteria were originally found in extreme environments like hot, deep ocean vents where ordinary bacteria could not survive and were dubbed "extremophiles", but have since been found in all environments. They are considered to be the oldest living organisms on the Earth. They are single-celled organisms, classified as <a href="#c1">prokaryotes</a>. They operate in the absence of oxygen only, and thus are dubbed "obligate anaerobes". </p><p>The three phyla of archaebacteria are the methanogens, the halophiles and the thermoacidophiles. </p><p><b>Methanogens</b> can harvest energy by converting H<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> into methane gas. This must be done in the absence of oxygen. They operate deep in marshes, and are found in the intestinal tracts of humans, cows, and some other animals.</p><p><b>Halophiles</b> thrive in the presence of extremely high salt levels, which would kill ordinary bacteria. They are found  in the Dead Sea, the Great Salt Lake, and other areas with a high salt content.</p><p><b> Thermoacidophiles </b> are found in extremely acidic conditions and in areas with very high temperatures. "They can survive in areas with temperatures as high as 230 degrees Fahrenheit and with <a href="../chemical/ph.html#c1">pHs</a> below 2 (hydrochloric acid, which is incredibly strong, has a pH of 1). These locations include volcanic vents and hydrothermal vents (cracks in the ocean floor where scalding water leaks out)."(Accessed at <a href="http://co.essortment.com/archaebacteriae_rmkr.htm">essortment</a>)</p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="bioref.html#c1">Audesirk & Audesirk</a><br> Ch 4<br><br>Reference<br><a href="bioref.html#c1">Hickman, Roberts, Larson</a><br></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="biocon.html#heacon">   Biology </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY>
