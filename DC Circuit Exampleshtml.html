                      DC Circuit Examples The basic tools for solving D C circuit problems are Ohm's      Index Law, the power relationship, the voltage law, and the current law. The following configurations are typical; details may be     DC examined by clicking on the diagram for the desired circuit.

It may be analyzed by direct application of the voltage law and the current law, but some other approaches are also useful.                                                                    Index         Given the voltages, current analysis may be carried out     DC         by:                                                      Circuits          [Image] Voltage and current laws [Image]  [Image] Superposition theorem          [Image] Thevenin's theorem          [Image] Norton's theorem   HyperPhysics***** Electricity and Magnetism                    Go Back
