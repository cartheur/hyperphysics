A clear afternoon brought a beautiful sunset, with a good view of the sun going down behind a wooded mountain. It was inspiring enough to train my video camera on the sun during the last few seconds before it dropped below the mountain. </td></tr></table><center><img src="atmpic/greenmaybe.jpg"></center><p>Watching through the viewfinder of the video camera, I was surprised to see the distinct green flash just before the sun disappeared. On the digital video camera, only two frames showed evidence of the green light, so only 1/15 of a second showed the phenomenon. To be sure, the image above is not very convincing, but if you look closely, you will see a hint of green at the top of the sun image. It was much more dramatic through the viewfinder. I never expected to be able to see it over a wooded mountain - I had heard reports only of sea views and views over bare rock mountains. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="atmoscon.html#c1">Atmospheric optics concepts</a><BR><BR>References<br><a href="../optics/optref.html#c1">Schaaf<br><br>Greenler<br><br>Meinel & Meinel<br><br>Minnaert</a><br><br><a href="http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/"><img src="imgatm/exlnk.gif" ><br>Green Flash</a><br>by Andrew Young</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../ligcon.html#c1">     Light and Vision </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
