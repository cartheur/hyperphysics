The perceived pitch of a sound is just the ear's response to frequency, i.e., for most practical purposes the pitch is just the frequency. The pitch perception of the human <a href="ear-2.html#c1">ear</a> is understood to operate basically by the <a href= "place-2.html#c1" >place theory</a>, with some <a href="place-2.html#c2">sharpening</a> mechanism necessary to explain the remarkably <a href="earsens-2.html#c3">high resolution</a> of human pitch perception.</p>     <p>The place theory and its refinements provide plausible models for the perception of the relative pitch of two tones, but do not explain the phenomenon of <a href="#c4">perfect pitch</a>. </p>    <p> The <a href="../music/cents.html#c4">just noticeable difference</a> in pitch is conveniently expressed in <a href="../music/cents.html#c1">cents</a>, and the standard figure for the human ear is 5 cents. </p> <center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="#c2">More detail</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="hearcon-2.html#c1">Hearing concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="placecon-2.html#c1">Place theory concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="soucon-2.html">     Sound </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c2"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Details About Pitch</H1><p>Although for most practical purposes, the <a href="#c1">pitch</a> of a sound can be said to be simply a measure of its frequency, there are circumstances in which a constant frequency sound can be perceived to be changing in pitch. </p>    <p>One of most consistently observed "psychoacoustic" effects is that a sustained high frequency sound (>2kHz) which is increased steadily in intensity will be perceived to be rising in pitch, whereas a low frequency sound (<2kHz) will be perceived to be dropping in pitch. (<a href="#c3">More detail</a>)</p>   <p> The perception of the pitch of short pulses differs from that of sustained sounds of the same measured frequency. If a short pulse of a pure tone is decaying in amplitude, it will be perceived to be higher in pitch than an identical pulse which has steady amplitude. Interfering tones or noise can cause an apparent pitch shift. </p>    <p>Further discussion of these and other perceptual aspects of pitch may be found in Chapter 7 of Rossing, The Science of Sound, 2nd.

Sometimes called "Stevens's rule" after an early investigator, this psychoacoustic effect has been extensively investigated. </p>   <p> With an increase of sound intensity from 60 to 90 <a href="db-2.html#c1">decibels</a>, Terhardt found that the pitch of a 6kHz pure tone was perceived to rise over 30 <a href="../music/cents.html#c1">cents</a>. A 200 Hz tone was found to drop about 20 cents in perceived pitch over the same intensity change. </p>    <p> Studies with the sounds of musical instruments show less perceived pitch change with increasing intensity. Rossing reports a perceived pitch change of around 17 cents for a change from 65 dB to 95 dB. This perceived change can be upward or downward, depending upon which harmonics are predominant. For example, if the majority of the intensity comes from harmonics which are above 2 kHz, the perceived pitch shift will be upward. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="hearcon-2.html#c1">Hearing concepts</a><BR><BR>References<br><a href="souref-2.html#c1">Terhardt</a><br><br><a href="souref-2.html#c1">Rossing</a><br>Science of Sound<br>Ch 7</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="soucon-2.html">     Sound </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c4"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Perfect Pitch</H1><p>"Perfect pitch" or "absolute pitch" refers to the ability of some persons to recognize the pitch of a musical note without any discernable pitch standard, as if the person can recognize a pitch like the eye discerns the color of an object.
