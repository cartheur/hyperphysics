Most survey sound-level meters have just two options: dBA and dBC. This is because low-cost sound survey meters will not have a certified dB scale, but can meet the standards for dBC which has a small discrimination against very high and very low sounds. Practically, dBC and dB are essentially the same. So good practice for a sound survey with such a  meter would be to measure in both dBA and dBC in every location. The difference between them gives you information about the frequency distribution of the sound and helps to avoid misleading results in cases where there is a significant change in the frequency distribution in different measurement locations. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="hearcon.html#c1">Hearing concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="dbcon.html#c1">Sound level measurement</a><BR><BR><a href="dbcon.html#c2">Sound measurement examples</a><BR><BR>Reference<br><a href="souref.html">Backus</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="soucon.html">     Sound </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c2"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Factory Sound Measurements</H1><center><img src="imgsou/frito2.gif"></center><p>These sound measurements were made in a small quality-control lab some 15 meters from the packaging line. The <a href="acont.html#c2">A contour</a> measurement of 62 dBA indicates that a comfortable level for working has been established by soundproofing this lab. The level inside the small lab was noticeably lower than that just outside its door. The large difference between the A-contour and straight <a href=db.html#c1">decibel</a> reading is an indication that there is a preponderance of low-frequency sound background in the lab. This is to be expected, since it is more difficult to remove low frequency noise. Low frequency sounds are more efficiently structure-borne than high frequencies, so that insulation in walls, etc.  is not as effective in removing the lows. The low frequencies will come in on the structural supports of the enclosure. </p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="#c1">Statement of example</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="hearcon.html#c1">Hearing concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="dbcon.html#c1">Sound level measurement</a><BR><BR><a href="dbcon.html#c2">Sound measurement examples</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="soucon.html">     Sound </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c3"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Factory Sound Measurements</H1>    <p>The sound level was quite high in the area where high-speed packaging equipment was operating.

The small difference of 5-6 dB between the <a href="acont.html#c2">A contour</a> and straight <a href=db.html#c1">decibel</a> measurements indicates that most of the sound energy was at mid-range frequencies where the A-contour and the human ear are most receptive. </p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="#c1">Statement of example</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="hearcon.html#c1">Hearing concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="dbcon.html#c1">Sound level measurement</a><BR><BR><a href="dbcon.html#c2">Sound measurement examples</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="soucon.html">     Sound </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c4"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Factory Sound Measurements</H1><p>A sound measurement puzzle: when you went from the packaging area to the weighing area, the level in <a href="acont.html#c2">dBA</a> went down but the measured level in <a href=db.html#c1">dB</a> went up!! How can that be? In the weighing area, a rumbling conveyer belt took packaged product to an upper floor. The increase in that low frequency, partially inaudible sound drove the decibel level up. The increase in distance from the loud packaging machines dropped the audible sound level.  </p><center><img src="imgsou/frito4.gif"></center><p>This demonstrates the fact that it is good practice to measure sound fields in both flat dB and dBA in sound surveys. It helps to characterize the differences in sound frequency distributions in different locations and allows you to explain puzzling measurements like those above. For low-cost sound survey meters, there is usually a switch allowing you to switch from dBA to dBC(which is close to flat dB), so you could just switch back and forth from A to C contours at each measurement location.</p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="#c1">Statement of example</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="hearcon.html#c1">Hearing concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="dbcon.html#c1">Sound level measurement</a><BR><BR><a href="dbcon.html#c2">Sound measurement examples</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="soucon.html">     Sound </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c5"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>School Sound Measurements</H1><table><tr><td><p>A survey of sound level in some elementary school classrooms turned up the largest discrepancy between <a href="acont.html#c2">A-contour</a> and flat <a href=db.html#c1">decibel</a> measurements that the author has seen. In a particularschool there was a ground floor classroom next to the main airhandling units for the school whichyielded an astounding 60 dB difference between dBA and dBmeasurement. </p></td><td><img src="imgsou/schl.gif"></td></tr></table><p>This highlights thefutility of doing only flat decibelmeasurements inside of buildings. A combination of dB and dBA measurements gives a fairly balanced picture of the sound environment. In this extraordinary case, a great deal of effort had been made to sound-insulate the air-handling room, and this effort had indeed greatly reduced the audible sound transmission into the classroom. But very low frequency sounds vibrate the structures and are much more efficiently structure-borne to different locations in the building. The room was indeed fairly quiet to the ear, although you could feel a bit of the vibration in the floor. Some of that low frequency vibration was picked up by the high quality sound level meter when it was set to measure decibels, even though the ear was barely aware of it and the A-contour filter of the meter appropriately eliminated it. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="hearcon.html#c1">Hearing concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="dbcon.html#c1">Sound level measurement</a><BR><BR><a href="dbcon.html#c2">Sound measurement examples</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="soucon.html">     Sound </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
