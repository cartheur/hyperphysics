The result was a strong pulsating tone, the pulsations becoming more rapid as you tune farther away either upward or downward in pitch. The two displays above show the combined tones on a fast sweep to show the wave shape, and on a much slower sweep to show the rising and falling amplitude of the combined sounds. </p><table><tr><td><p>Click on the player at right to play the tone which produced the above display. The composite tone has a frequency of about 238 Hz. The time between minima is about 0.62 seconds, corresponding to a beat frequency of about 1.6 Hz. This implies that the two tones were 1.6 Hz apart in frequency. </p></td><td><center><embed src="soupic/beatbox.mov" height=75 width=75></center></td></tr></table><center><img src="soupic/beatrisea.jpg"></center><p>The above sound amplitude trace shows the beat phenomenon as one tone generator is tuned upward in pitch.</p><table><tr><td><p>Click on the player at right to play the sound of the tone generators as one is tuned upward while the other remains at its original pitch.  </p></td><td><center><embed src="soupic/beatrise.mov" height=75 width=75></center></td></tr></table></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="hearcon.html#c1">Hearing concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="trawvcon.html#c1">Traveling wave concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="soucon.html">     Sound </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
