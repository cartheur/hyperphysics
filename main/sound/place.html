It is hard to conceive of a mechanical resonance of the basilar membrane that sharp.

Several of the proposed mechanism have the nature of lateral inhibition on the basilar membrane. One way to sharpen the pitch perception would be bring the peak of the excitation pattern on the basilar membrane into greater relief by inhibiting the firing of those hair cells which are adjacent to the peak. Since nerve cells obey an "all-or-none" law, discharging when receiving the appropriate stimulus and then drawing energy from the metabolism to recharge before firing again, one form the lateral inhibition could take is the inhibition of the recharging process since the cells at the peak of the response will be drawing energy from the surrounding fluid most rapidly. Inhibition of the lateral hair cells could also occur at the ganglia, with some kind of inhibitory gating which lets through only those pulses from the cells which are firing most rapidly. It is known that there are feedback signals from the brain to the hair cells, so the inhibition could occur by that means. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="placecon.html#c1">Place theory concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="hearcon.html#c1">Hearing concepts</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="souref.html">McGutin</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="soucon.html">     Sound </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
