It is made up mostly of organic matter. Microscopic examination reveals plant matter - leaves, bark, wood. This plant matter has been compacted over a long time period. It is presumed to have its origin in plant matter that has been buried in an oxygen-deficient environment like a swamp and then compacted over time.  </p><p>Lignite and bituminous coals are considered to be just sedimentary rocks, but anthracite coal is metamorphic. Anthracite has been altered by the pressures of folding and deformation during mountain building. </p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="sedime.html#c1">Sedimentary Rocks</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="gphysref.html#c1">Lutgens and Tarbuck</a><br>Ch 6</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="geophys.html#c1">    Geophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
