Actually, the current information indicates a small acceleration attributed to <a href="dareng.html#c1">dark energy</a>, but  it is still close enough to the <a href="fried.html#c4">critical density</a> that it makes sense to make ones first model that of a flat or critical universe. To that end, one can model the expansion in terms of a uniform density of particles which interact only gravitationally to create a framework from which to develop more refined models. Those more refined models are often expressed in the <a href="fried.html#c1">Friedman equation</a>.<table><tr><td><img src="imgast/newtexp.gif"></td><td>A spherical shell of mass m which is expanding can be described in terms of its <a href="../ke.html#ke">kinetic energy</a> and  <a href="../gpot.html#gpt">gravitational potential energy</a>, where that gravitational potential energy is contributed by the mass M<sub>r</sub> enclosed by the sphere. The spherical shell of mass has been given an energy E. </p></td></tr></table> <p>The mechanical energy can be expressed as follows, using the notation of Carroll and Ostlie:</p><center><img src="imgast/nex1.gif"></center><p>The term on the right is an expression for the total energy of the shell which has been constructed in a form to be of future usefulness. In that expression, c is the speed of light, m is the mass, k is a constant which will be used to represent the "<a href ="fried.html#c2">curvature</a>" of the space system, and &#982;  is a coordinate whose value represents the chosen mass shell and will remain constant as a "comoving coordinate" to specify that shell. The radius r(t) can then be expressed in terms of a time-dependent scale factor R(t) which specifies the expansion of the space and this comoving coordinate:</p><center><img src="imgast/nex2.gif"></center><p>Now making use of the <a href="hubble.html#c1">Hubble law</a>, we can express the velocity of the expanding shell as<center><img src="imgast/nex3.gif"></center><p>Since the velocity can also be expressed as<center><img src="imgast/nex4.gif"></center>we can express the Hubble parameter H(t) as<center><img src="imgast/nex5.gif"></center><p>Now these terms may be substituted into the energy expression above such that every term is a multiple of the comoving parameter &#982;  which may then be canceled out. This suggests that the resulting equations apply to any shell and constitute a description of the expanding space in terms of the expansion factor R(t) and the Hubble parameter H(t). The expansion equation can be put in the two equivalent forms</p><center><img src="imgast/nex6.gif"></center><br><center><table BORDER="1"><tr><td><a href="expuni2.html#c1">Mass-dominated expansion</a></td></tr></table></center><center><table BORDER="1"><tr><td><a href="expuni3.html#c1">Mass and radiation in the early universe</a></td></tr></table></center><center><table BORDER="1"><tr><td><a href="expuni3.html#c2">Radiation-dominated expansion</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR>References<br><a href="astref.html">Carroll & Ostlie</a><br>Ch. 29<br></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="astcon.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
