It is reminiscent of the Biblical phrase "Let there be light". But of course this is not <a href="../ems3.html#c2">visible light</a> but far beyond <a href="../ems3.html#c5">gamma rays</a> since the average <a href="../mod2.html#c3">photon energy</a> increases as one models earlier times and photon energies become high enough to accomplish pair production of all known particles. For example at a temperature of 10<sup>11</sup> K, modeled at a time of about 20 milliseconds into <a href="bbcloc.html#c1">Weinberg's model</a> of the big bang, the <a href="../kinetic/eqpar.html#c2">thermal energy</a> kT = 8.6 MeV. At this temperature, the peak energy given by the <a href="../wien.html#c2">Wien displacement law</a> is 42.8 MeV. The radiation energy was sufficient not only for <a href="../particles/lepton.html#c6">electron-positron<a> pair production, but also to maintain essentially equal populations of <a href="../particles/proton.html#c1">protons</a> and <a href="../particles/proton.html#c3">neutrons</a>. So in that era, radiation was truly dominant. </p><p>The <a href="../quantum/raddens.html#c1">radiation energy density</a> in astronomy texts is usually put in the form<center><img src="../quantum/imgqua/edena.gif"></center>where a is called the radiation constant and has the value<center><img src="../quantum/imgqua/edena2.gif"></center><p>For consistency with other particle quantities that are expressed in terms of the  number of degrees of freedom, this is sometimes written in the form<center><img src="imgast/radg.gif"></center>where the photon "g-factor" is g<sub>rad</sub> = 2 is the number of effective degrees of freedom associated with a photon: it's polarization can be parallel or anti-parallel to its motion. This notation facilitates its combination with <a href="#c2">neutrino energy density</a> in describing the contribution of <a href="#c3">relativistic particles</a> to the universe's energy density. </p><p>To assess the role of radiation in the expansion of the early universe, one must take a step beyond the simple <a href="expuni.html#c1">Newtonian expansion model</a> and include the <a href="transp.html#c2">radiation pressure</a>. When the radiation pressure is included, the effective density represented by the radiation as a function of the <a href="expuni.html#c1">scale factor</a> R is</p><center><img src="imgast/radden.gif"></center><p>The dependence on the fourth power of R distinguishes the radiation energy density from the mass density, which depends upon the third power of R,<center><img src="imgast/maden.gif"></center>implying that the balance of mass and radiation energy density changes with the expansion of the universe, making a transition from a <a href="expuni3.html#c2">radiation dominated era</a> to a <a href="expuni2.html#c1">mass dominated era</a>.</p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="expuni3.html#c1">Matter and radiation in the early universe</a></td></tr></table></center><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="uniage.html#c1">How old is the universe?</a></td></tr></table></center></TD></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="astref.html#c1"> Carroll & Ostlie</a><br>Ch 29</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="astcon.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c2"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Neutrinos in the Early Universe</H1><p><a href="../particles/neutrino.html#c1">Neutrinos</a> joined <a href="../ems1.html#c1">Electromagnetic radiation</a> as the dominant form of energy in the early universe, becoming more dominant as one models earlier times in the big bang. To assess the energy density in neutrinos, it would be  helpful to place it in a form similar to the energy density in <a href="#c1">radiation</a>, <center><img src="imgast/radg.gif"></center>but this requires a bit of analysis. For one thing, the neutrinos are <a href="../particles/spinc.html#c2">fermions</a> while the photons are <a href="../particles/spinc.html#c3">bosons</a>, so the neutrinos follow <a href="../quantum/disfd.html#c1">Fermi-Dirac statistics</a> while the photons obey <a href="../quantum/disbe.html#c1">Bose-Einstein statistics</a>. There are also three <a href="../particles/neutrino2.html#c2">types of neutrinos</a>, the electron, muon and tau neutrinos and with each is associated an antineutrino. One might expect two spin states, but one of the strange facts about neutrinos is their "<a href="../particles/neutrino3.html#c1">chirality</a>" - they are all "left-handed" and confined to one spin state. <p>Applying all the statistical factors gives a neutrino energy density expression<center><img src="imgast/radn.gif"></center>where g<sub>&#957;</sub> = 6 for the 3 neutrinos plus their antiparticles, and the multiple 7/8 comes from the fact that they are fermions rather than bosons. Each of the 6 species has only one spin state. </p><p>Another difference for the neutrinos is the fact that their effective temperature at the present time is different  from the 2.725K of the cosmic microwave background. Analysis of the neutrino temperature leads to the prediction that the neutrino temperature is <center><table ><tr><td><img src="imgast/radn2.gif"> </td><td> <table BORDER="1"><tr><td><a href="neutemp.html#c1">More detail</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></center>which puts the neutrino background at a temperature of 1.9 K. The neutrino energy expression then becomes <center><img src="imgast/radn3.gif"></center>when stated in terms of the temperature of the electromagnetic radiation. Even though we have not been able to detect the cosmic neutrino background because of the great difficulty of <a href="../particles/neutrino.html#c2">neutrino detection</a>, we are confident that it is there, and the projection of its energy density is about  68% of that of the cosmic microwave background . </p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="#c3">Relativistic particle density</a></td></tr></table></center><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="expuni3.html#c1">Matter and radiation in the early universe</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="astref.html#c1"> Carroll & Ostlie</a><br>Ch 29</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="astcon.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c3"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Relativistic Particle Density &#937;<sub>Rel</sub></H1><p><a href="#c2">Neutrinos</a> joined <a href="#c1">Electromagnetic radiation</a> as the dominant form of energy in the early universe, becoming more dominant as one models earlier times in the big bang.
