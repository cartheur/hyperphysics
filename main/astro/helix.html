The Helix Nebula is the closest example of a planetary nebula created at the end of the life of a Sun-like star. The outer gasses of the star  expelled into space appear from our vantage point as if we are looking down a helix. The remnant central stellar core, destined to become a <a href="whdwar.html#c1">white dwarf star</a>, glows in light so  energetic it causes the previously expelled gas to fluoresce. The Helix Nebula, given a technical designation of  NGC 7293, lies about 650 light-years away towards the  constellation of  Aquarius and spans about 2.5 light-years. The above picture is a  composite of newly released images from the  <a href="../solar/hubinst.html#c2">ACS</a> instrument on the  <a href="../solar/hst.html#c1">Hubble Space Telescope</a> and wide-angle images from the Mosaic Camera on the  WIYN  0.9-m Telescope at  Kitt Peak National Observatory. A close-up of the inner edge of the Helix Nebula shows complex gas knots of  unknown origin."(NASA description)</p><p>Credit: NASA,  WIYN, NOAO,  ESA,  Hubble Helix Nebula Team,  M.

In this image the filaments can be seen under the transparent blue gas as red lines radiating out from the center. Astronomers believe that the molecules in these filaments are able to stay cooler and more stable because dense clumps of materials are shielding them from ultraviolet radiation. This image is a composite showing ionized H-alpha (green) and O III (blue) gases from the Hubble Space Telescope, and molecular hydrogen (red) from the <a href="../solar/spitzer.html#c1">Spitzer Space Telescope</a> observations at 4.5 and 8.0 microns.</p>Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/ESA/J.
