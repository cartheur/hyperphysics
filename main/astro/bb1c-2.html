The <a href="bbcloc-2.html#c1">first segment</a> in which the process is so characterized, the temperature is 10<sup>11</sup> Kelvin. Given that temperature, how do you calculate the associated time and particle energy?</p><p>The mean energy associated with a particle in thermal equilibrium at temperature T is kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant. So the characteristic particle energy at this temperature is</p><center>kT = (8.6 x 10<sup>-5</sup> eV/K)(10<sup>11</sup>K) = 8.6 MeV</center><p>One important piece of information that we have is the <a href="expand-2.html#c1">energy density</a> in the <a href="../bkg3k.html#c1">3K background radiation</a>, which is about 0.25 MeV/m<sup>3</sup> at the present time. From the <a href="../thermo/stefan.html#c1">Stefan-Boltzmann law</a>, we know that the energy density is proportional to T<sup>4</sup>, so we could scale the energy up to the temperature 10<sup>11</sup> K.  But this includes only the energy of the photons, and there are neutrinos, electrons and positrons also in thermal equilibrium at that time. The thermal energy at 8.6 MeV is so high compared to the pair-production threshold of about 1 MeV for the production of <a href="../particles/lepton.html#c6">electron-positron pairs</a> that it must be assumed that they are being continuously created. The collection of electrons and positrons is "radiation like", being in thermal equilibrium with the photons and neutrinos.  </p><p>The known energy density of the photon background radiation can be scaled up to the target temperature and adjusted to include the neutrinos, electrons and positrons if we know the relative populations of each in the expanding big bang. At these high temperatures, those populations can be treated statistically, and the <a href="../particles/parpop.html#c1">effective number of species</a> of the particles established. Those populations relative to the photons are:</p><center>Neutrinos: 7/4  , Electrons and positrons: 7/4</center><p>The energy density in the expanding big bang at 10<sup>11</sup>K can then be calculated:</p><center><img src="imgast/engdens-2.gif"></center><p>Substituting this into <a href="fried-2.html#c1">Friedman's equation</a> for the expansion time gives</p><center><img src="imgast/texp-2.gif"></center><p>The <a href="bbcloc-2.html#c2">next step</a> in Weinberg's scenario has time 0.11 sec and temperature 3 x 10<sup>10</sup>K. If you just plug into the above relationship for that temperature, you get expansion time 0.24 seconds. I'm not clear on how you get 0.11 seconds.</p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="expand-2.html#c3">Temperature and expansion time</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR>Reference<br><a href="../quaref.html">Rohlf</a><br>Ch. 19</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="astcon-2.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
