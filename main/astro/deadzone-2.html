Ward and Brownlee catalog some places where you would <u>not</u> expect such life, for the indicated reasons.</p><ul><li>Early universe: the most distant known galaxies represent galaxies formed early in the history of the universe. As such they would not have had time for sufficient <a href="nucsyn-2.html">heavy element production</a> to support life. Stars in such galaxies would not have enough heavy elements to form Earth-size inner planets. <li>Globular clusters: Even though <a href="magclo-2.html#c2">globular clusters</a> like <a href="magclo-2.html#c2">Omega Centauri</a> may have a million or more stars, they are too <a href="nucsyn-2.html#c2">metal poor</a> to have inner planets as large as the Earth. The dearth of "metals" indicates great age, so solar mass stars may have evolved to the <a href="redgia-2.html#c2">red giant</a> stage which would be too hot for life on inner planets. Globular clusters often  have such high star density that the orbits of planets would be disturbed. <li>Elliptical galaxies: like globular clusters, the stars are too metal poor to produce Earth-like planets.<li>Small galaxies: the production of heavy elements is too small to provide the raw material to produce Earth-like planets.<li>Centers of galaxies: energetic processes would impede the development of life. Too much ionizing radiation.<li>Edges of galaxies: the stars would be too metal-poor.<li>Planetary systems with giant planets in elliptical orbits: the planets would so severely perturb inner rocky planets that advanced life could not form. <li>Future stars: Uranium, thorium and potassium may be too rare to provide the necessary <a href="wcradheat-2.html#c1">planet heating</a> to drive <a href="wcplate-2.html#c1">plate tectonics</a>. </ul></ul></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="wcearth-2.html#c1">Habitable planet concepts</a><br><br><a href="astref-2.html#c1">Ward & Brownlee</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="astcon-2.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
