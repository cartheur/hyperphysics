This can be brightening by hundreds of millions of times. The brightening may occur within a few days or weeks, but usually fades again within months. There are some recurring novae, but most are one-time events. One model of novae suggests that they occur in binary systems where one is a <a href= "whdwar.html#c1" >white dwarf</a> and the other is on its way to becoming a <a href= "redgia.html#c1" >red giant </a>. The red giant can lose mass which would trigger <a href="procyc.html#c1">hydrogen fusion</a> as it falls on the white dwarf. This would blow the gas off and the process could repeat itself. A notable nova example is <a href="#c2">Nova Cygni 1975</a>. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="astref.html">Pasachoff</a><br>Ch. 7</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>**********<A HREF="astcon.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c2"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Nova Cygni 1975</H1>The brightest <a href="#c1">Nova</a> in recent years was Nova Cygni 1975 which becamevisible in Cygnus in August.
