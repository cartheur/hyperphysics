This splitting is described well by the <a href="zeeman.html#c2">Zeeman effect</a> if the splitting is small compared to the energy difference between the unperturbed levels, i.e., for sufficiently weak magnetic fields. This can be visualized with the help of a <a href="vecmod.html#c3">vector model</a> of total angular momentum. If the magnetic field is large enough, it disrupts the coupling between the orbital and spin angular momenta, resulting in a different pattern of splitting. This effect is called the Paschen-Back effect. </p><table><tr><td><img src= "imgqua/paschen.gif"></td><td><p>In the weak field case the vector model at left implies that the coupling of the orbital angular momentum L to the spin angular momentum S is stronger than their coupling to the external field. In this case where <a href="hydfin.html#c2">spin-orbit coupling</a> is dominant, they can be visualized as combining to form a total angular momentum J which then precesses about the magnetic field direction. </p><p>In the strong-field case, S and L couple more strongly to the external magnetic field than to each other, and can be visualized as independently precessing about the external field direction. </p></td></tr></table><p>For reference, the <a href="sodzee.html#c2">sodium Zeeman effect</a> is reproduced below to show the nature of the magnetic interaction for weak external magnetic fields.</p><center><img src="imgqua/Sodzee.gif"></center><p>The following is a model of the changes in the pattern if the magnetic field were strong enough to decouple L and S. The resulting spectrum would be a triplet with the center line twice the intensity of the outer lines. </p><center><img src="imgqua/Sodpas.gif"></center><p>To create this pattern, the projections of L and S in the z-direction have been treated independently and the m<sub>s</sub> multiplied by the <a href="zeeman.html#c5">spin g-factor</a>. The energy shift is expressed as a multiple of the <a href="zeeman.html#c2">Bohr magneton</a>  <font face="symbol">m</font><sub>B</sub>. The <a href="hydazi.html#c3">selection rules</a> explain why the transitions shown are allowed and others not. <p><p>Sodium was used as the basis of the model for convenience, but the fields required to create Paschen-Back conditions for sodium are unrealistically high. Lithium, on the other hand, has a spin-orbit splitting of only 0.00004 eV compared to 0.0021 eV for sodium. Such small energy values are sometimes expressed in "wavenumbers", or 1/<font face="symbol">l</font> in cm<sup>-1</sup>. In these units the lithium separation is about 0.3 cm<sup>-1</sup>and the sodium separation is about 17 cm<sup>-1</sup> .The Paschen-Back conditions are met in some lithium spectra observed on the Sun, so this effect does have astronomical significance. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="hydcn.html#c1">Hydrogen concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../quacon.html#quacon">     Quantum Physics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
