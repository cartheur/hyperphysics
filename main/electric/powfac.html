In so doing, they incur more line losses. They also must have larger capacity equipment in place than would be otherwise necessary. As a result, an industrial facility will be charged a penalty if its power factor is much different from 1. </p>     <p>Industrial facilities tend to have a "lagging power factor", where the current lags the voltage (like an <a href="acind.html#c1">inductor</a>). This is primarily the result of having a lot of electric induction motors - the windings of motors act as inductors as seen by the power supply. <a href="accap.html#c1">Capacitors</a> have the opposite effect and can compensate for the inductive motor windings. Some industrial sites will have large banks of capacitors strictly for the purpose of correcting the power factor back toward one to save on utility company charges. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="accircon.html#c1">AC Circuits</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../emcon.html#emcon">     Electricity and Magnetism </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
