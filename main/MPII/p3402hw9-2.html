Looks like to me that<br>spin can be either zero or 1, so j=0,1,2,3,4 possible.<p>#10. For two electrons in d subshell, what values for z-component ofangular momentum possible?<br>The orbital angular momentum can stretch from 0 to 4. For S=0 it cantake L=0,2,4 and for S=1, L=1,3.<br>So the total angular momentum can take values 0,1,2,3,4. Mj can thentake -4,-3, … 2,3,4.<p>#16 Energy level diagram for silicon<br>With two outer 3p electrons, the energy levels are expected to be verymuch like those for carbon<br>shown in Figure 9-12, p269. My guess is a reproduction of the carbonlevel diagram<br>with all the principal quantum numbers jogged up by one. Expect thatthe ground<br>state is a 3p triplet state, and that of the other two 3p states, theone with the higher total angular<br>momentum (j=2) will be lower. Sp3 states could be expected as in carbon.<p>#19 Predict splitting for Stern-Gerlach experiment with other atoms.<br>No splitting: No electrons outside of closed shells, so the noble gasesshould exhibit no splitting.<br>Threefold splitting: Triplet state, spin=1. Can occur with two outerelectrons, like carbon and silicon.<br>Fourfold splitting would come with spin=3/2, which could come withthree electrons, like nitrogen.<p>#20&nbsp; Magnetic splitting with a 3d 5/2 state.<br>The number of magnetic levels is 2j+1 = 6<p>#21. Splitting of a 2p state in a strong magnetic field.<br>The strong field magnetic splitting (Paschen-Back effect) depends uponml + 2ms.<br>You look at the orbital and spin values separately, then combine. Thevalues for<br>ml are -1,0,1 and the values of 2ms are -1 and 1. The possible combinationsare<br>&nbsp;-2,-1,0,1,2.&nbsp; Since the splitting is (ml+2ms)* Bohr magneton*magnetic field in Tesla<br>Then the splitting is numerically equal to the quantum numbers -2,-1,0,1,2times the<br>Bohr magneton.<br>This gives -11.8, -5.9, 0, 5.9, 11.8 times 1E-5 eV in a 1 Tesla field.<br>&nbsp;</body>
