<HEAD>   <META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1">   <META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="Mozilla/4.01 (Macintosh; U; PPC) [Netscape]"></HEAD><BODY>Rohlf Chapter 17. #2,12,13,16,17,21<P>#2&nbsp; Calculate the kinetic energy of a muon produced by the decayof a pion at rest.<BR>The muon and muon antineutrino produced must go in opposite directionswith the<BR>same momentum. Since the antineutrino is essentially massless, E=pcfor it.<BR>The kinetic energy of the muon is related to it by KE = Q -pc. Theenergy Q<BR>released by the decay is equal to Q=139.57 MeV - 105.66 MeV = 33.9MeV<BR>For the muon, (pc)^2 = KE^2 + 2*KE*mc^2 from reducing the relativisticenergy expression.<BR>Substituting the expression for Q and pc into this gives<BR>pc=(Q^2 + 2*Q*mc^2)/(2*(Q+mc^2))=(33.9^2+2*33.9*105.66)/(2*(33.9+105.66))=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29.78 MeV<BR>The kinetic energy of the muon is then KE= Q-pc=33.9 - 29.78=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.13 MeV<P>#12&nbsp; The&nbsp; omega minus baryon has the quark constitution sss,but the quarks are fermions<BR>with spin 1/2, so no two of them can be identical states. This impliesa fundamental property which has three possible values<BR>rather than the two possible values of electric charge. It is the threedistinct parameter values which suggested<BR>the three primary colors as a visual metaphor, hence "color".<P>#13 A mystery baryon has strangeness -2 and charge zero.<BR>a. The isospin projection mI = q/e - (S+B)/2 =1/2, corresponding toan isospin of 1/2<BR>The particle is neutral and the s quark has a charge of -1/3, so thethird quark has a charge +2/3<BR>This would make it either an up or a charm, with u being the likelychoice.<BR>The uss is called a Xi baryon.<P>#16 Pick out the possible reactions:<BR>a.&nbsp;&nbsp; p + p -> pi zero + n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO. violatesconservation of baryon number, B=0 on left, B=1 on right.<BR>b.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pi minus + p ->Kzero + n&nbsp;&nbsp; NO. Conserves chargeand baryon number, no leptons involved, but the Kaon contains a<BR>strange quark and strangeness is not conserved.<BR>c. p + p -> pi plus + n+n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO doesn't conserve charge<BR>d. p + p -> pi zero + pi plus + pi minus&nbsp;&nbsp; YES ConservesBaryon number, charge, doesn' t have leptons.<BR>e. K- + p -> pi0 + lambda zero&nbsp; YES with enough energy to createthe lambda. Conserves Baryon number<BR>charge and strangeness.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>#17. Pick out the possible decays and indicate relevant force.<BR>a. Sigma zero -> lambda zero + gamma&nbsp;&nbsp; YES, electromagnetic.Conserves B, S, charge<BR>b. n -> p + pi minus&nbsp;&nbsp; NO Conserves all the relevant quantumnumbers, but violates conservation of energy<BR>c. Delta minus -> n + pi minus&nbsp;&nbsp; YES Delta minus is excitedstate of ddd, so with enough energy it can give a ddu plus an ud. It goesby strong interaction.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>#21 Estimate the mean free path of a 1 GeV neutrino in the Earth.<BR>The mean free path can be estimated by calculating the cross sectionfor interaction times the number of nucleons per unit volume and then takethe reciprocal.<BR>The density of the earth is about 5000 kg/m^3.<BR>The number of nucleons per unit volume is approximately the densitydivided by the mass per nucleon<BR>n= 5000 kg/m^3/ (1.7x10^-27 kg) = 3 x 10^30.<BR>The cross section for interaction of a neutrino is 10^-42 m^2<BR>Mean free path = 1/((1E-42 m^2)*(3E30 m^-3)) = 3x10^11 meters.<P>&nbsp;</BODY>
