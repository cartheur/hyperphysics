T. R. Wilson, a Scottish physicist, devised the cloud chamber. The general procedure was to allow water to evaporate in an enclosed container to the point of saturation and then lower the pressure, producing a super-saturated volume of air. Then the passage of a charged particle would  condense the vapor into tiny droplets, producing a visible trail marking the particle's path.  </p><p>The device came to be called the Wilson cloud chamber and was used widely in the study of radioactivity. An alpha particle left a broad, straight path of definite length while an electron produced a light path with bends due to collisions. Gamma rays did not produce a visible track since they produce very few ions in air. The Wilson cloud chamber led to the discovery of recoil electrons from x-ray and gamma ray collisions, the <a href="../quantum/comptint.html#c1">Compton-scattered electrons</a>, and was used to discover the first intermediate mass particle, the <a href="lepton.html#c3">muon</a>. Wilson was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1927 for the development of the cloud chamber. </p><table><tr><td><img src="imgpar/cloudimg.jpg"></td><td>The images at left are typical of those obtained by Wilson (C.
