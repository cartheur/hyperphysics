A fuel cell uses a chemical reaction to provide an external voltage, as does a battery, but differs from a battery in that the fuel is continually supplied in the form of hydrogen and oxygen gas. It can produce electrical energy at a higher efficiency than just burning the hydrogen to produce heat to drive a generator because it is not subject to the <a href="seclaw2.html#c1">thermal bottleneck</a> from the <a href="seclaw.html#c1">second law of thermodynamics</a>.

Since the total entropy will not decrease in the reaction, the excess entropy in the amount T&#916S must be expelled to the environment as heat at temperature T. The amount of energy per mole of hydrogen which can be provided as electrical energy is the change in the <a href="helmholtz.html#c2">Gibbs free energy</a>:</P><center>&#916G = &#916H - T&#916S = -285.83 kJ + 48.7 kJ = -237.1 kJ</center><p>For this ideal case, the fuel energy is converted to electrical energy at an efficiency of 237.1/285.8 x100% = 83%! This is far greater than the ideal efficiency of a generating facility which burned the hydrogen and used the heat to power a generator! Although real fuel cells do not approach that ideal efficiency, they are still much more efficient than any electric power plant which burns a fuel.</p><center>Comparison of electrolysis and the fuel cell process</center><p>In comparing the fuel cell process to its reverse reaction, <a href="#c1">electrolysis</a> of water, it is useful treat the enthalpy change as the overall energy change. The Gibbs free energy is that which you actually have to supply if you want to drive a reaction, or the amount that you can actually get out if the reaction is working for you. So in the electrolysis/fuel cell pair where the enthalpy change is 285.8 kJ, you have to put in 237 kJ of energy to drive electrolysis and the heat from the environment will contribute T&#916S=48.7 kJ to help you. Going the other way in the fuel cell, you can get out the 237 kJ as electric energy, but have to dump T&#916S = 48.7 kJ to the environment. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="intengcon.html#c1">Internal energy concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="../chemical/echemcon.html#c1">Electrochemistry concepts</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="heatrf.html#c1">Schroeder</a><br>Ch 5<br><br>Reference<br><a href="heatrf.html#c1">Kartha & Grimes</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../heacon.html#heacon">     Thermodynamics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
