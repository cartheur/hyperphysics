A recent summary of the case for CO<sub>2</sub> as the main <a href="radfor.html#c1">radiative forcing</a> for the human influence on <a href="grnhse.html#c5">global warming</a> is Collins, et al. An active internet discussion site for climate scientists and others is <a href="http://www.realclimate.org/">Real Climate</a>. <p>But climate modeling is very complex, the stakes are very high, and there are numerous special interests. This situation is tailor-made for controversy. The following are some of the types of objections that skeptics of CO<sub>2</sub>-driven global warming raise:</p><ul><li>The <a href="co2suf.html#c1">CO<sub>2</sub> is not sufficient</a> to drive the currently observed warming.<li>The atmospheric  CO<sub>2</sub> level has been up to 10 times <a href="co2past.html#c1">higher in the past</a>. Why weren't there catastrophic consequences then?<li>Much of this <a href="temp20.html#c1">century's temperature rise</a> was in early years when industrial emissions were small, and there was a temperature decrease during the postwar economic boom.<li><a href="icecore.html#c1">Ice core records</a> show CO<sub>2</sub> rises lagging temperature rises rather than driving them. <li><a href="surwarm.html#c1">Surface warming</a> is more than atmospheric warming, in contrast to CO<sub>2</sub>-driven models.<li>The global temperature of t he past century correlates more strongly with <a href="solact.html#c1">solar activity</a> than with CO<sub>2</sub>.<li>The sunspot activity of  our Sun and the associated magnetic fields divert some of the <a href="suncos.html#c1">cosmic rays that nucleate clouds</a> on the Earth. </li></ul><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="grnhse.html#c5">Recent global temperatures</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br>References<br><a href="heatrf.html">Collins, et al. </a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../heacon.html#heacon">     Thermodynamics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
