But the moisture, even in saturated air at body temperature (from blowing up the balloon) provides a <a href="../kinetic/watvap.html#c1">vapor pressure</a> of only 47 mmHg, a reduction in volume of only about 6% of the total. The next suggestion is that the oxygen in the air will condense out. The boiling point of oxygen is 90K compared to the 77K for nitrogen, so would be expected to condense out. But the <a href="../kinetic/barfor.html#c6">oxygen content</a> of air is only 21% or about 159 mmHg, so that is not enough to explain the almost complete collapse. </p><p>So it is clear that most of the nitrogen itself from the air in the balloon liquifies to get the degree of collapse which is observed. The answer to why it condenses is not so clearcut. The air in the balloon is at an elevated pressure, and increasing the pressure will raise the <a href="../kinetic/vappre.html#c4">boiling point temperature</a> at which the gas can liquify, but that would appear to be a small effect. It seems that the main explanation comes from the fact that the air is a mixture and that the <a href="liqair.html#c1">liquification of air</a> occurs at a higher temperature than pure nitrogen gas, around 79 K at atmospheric pressure. </p><p>There are still some mysteries in the behavior of the balloon in liquid nitrogen. Since<a href="../pasc.html#pp">Pascal's law</a> dictates that the pressure is the same at all points inside the balloon,then we know that when we put one end in the liquid nitrogen and itstarts to shrink while the end in our hand still appears normal, then the internalpressure at that point has not changed significantly.<a href="../ptens.html#lap"> Laplace's law</a> gives us arelationship between the <a href="../ptens.html#bal">balloon radius </a>and the internal pressure, so as longas a piece of the balloon is in the air and is close to its original radius, then we aremaintaining about the same internal pressure in the balloon. From the amount of theballoon that we can get to collapse, we know that we have frozen outthe water content and liquified the oxygen and then have begun to liquify the nitrogeninside the balloon. At this point there are still some uncertainties in my mind - theinflation of a portion of the balloon still implies an internalpressure above atmospheric, but I don't know how much pressure is required.</p><p>The balloon material remains remarkably airtight during this extreme process, asindicated by the fact that you can cool and warm it up several times with no apparentchange in volume. </p>  </TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="tempercon.html#c1">Temperature concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="liqn2.html#c1">Liquid nitrogen</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../heacon.html#heacon">     Thermodynamics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
