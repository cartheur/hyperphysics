Then in the post-war industrial boom when CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were higher, the temperature actually dropped significantly. </p><p>Current climatologists would see this as no problem to their modeling, since it is projected that the affects of <a href="humimp.html#c1">human activity</a> did not produce significant divergence from natural forcings until the post 1970 period. The drop in temperature in the 1940-1965 period is partially modeled in terms of the concentration of sulphate aerosols; those aerosols were reduced after that period. </p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="gwskeptic.html">Skeptical views of CO<sub>2</sub> driven global warming</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br>References<br><a href="heatrf.html">Collins, et al. </a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../heacon.html#heacon">     Thermodynamics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
