A lot of energy goes into these phase transitions.

The object is to get it cool enough to drink in the shortest possible time. </td></tr><tr><td><a href="../kinetic/vappre.html#c3"><img src="imgheat/ques.gif"></a></td><td>What is the difference between evaporation and boiling?</td></tr><tr><td><a href="thexp2.html#c1"><img src="imgheat/ques.gif"></a></td><td>If you heat a uniform metal plate with a hole in it, will the hole get larger or smaller?</td></tr><tr><td><a href="coobod.html#c2"><img src="imgheat/ques.gif"></a></td><td>Heat flow is normally from a high temperature toward a low temperature region.
