If any two of these state variables is specified, the third is determined. This implies that the states of the substance can be represented as a surface in a three dimensional PvT space. The PvT surface above represents a substance which expands upon freezing. The vast majority of substances <a href="pvtsur.html#c1">contract upon freezing</a>. The  notable exception is <a href="../chemical/watercon.html#c1">water</a> for which the expansion upon freezing has an enormous impact on the nature of the Earth. A considerable amount of information about the phases of matter can be illustrated with the PvT surface.</p><p>The solid, liquid and gas(vapor) phases can be represented by regions on the surface. Note that there are regions on the surface which represent a single phase, and regions which are combinations of two phases. A point lying on a line between a single-phase and a two-phase region represents a "saturation state". The line between the liquid and the liquid-vapor regions is called the liquid-saturation line and any point on that line represents a saturated-liquid state. A point on the boundary between the vapor and the liquid-vapor regions is called a saturated-vapor state.</p><p>Note the critical state where the saturated-liquid and saturated-vapor lines meet. The state variables of this unique point are denoted by P<sub>c</sub>, v<sub>c</sub> and T<sub>c</sub>. If a substance is above the critical temperature T<sub>c</sub>, it cannot condense into a liquid, no matter how high the pressure. This merging of the liquid and vapor states above the critical temperature is a characteristic of all known substances. While a pure vapor state can exist at a pressure lower than P<sub>c</sub>, at pressures above P<sub>c</sub> it is <u>constrained</u> to be a vapor. States with pressures above P<sub>c</sub> are described as "supercritical states".</p><p>The remarkable "triple state" of matter where solid, liquid and vapor are in equilibrium may be characterized by a temperature called the triple point. The triple state is represented by a line parallel to the Pv plane with a characteristic pressure for the substance but variable volume. The triple point temperature of water is assigned the value 273.16 K and the triple state of water is used as the reference for establishing the <a href="temper.html#c3">Kelvin temperature scale</a>. </p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="../tables/phase.html#c4">Table of triple-state data</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="heatrf.html#c1">Wark and Richards</a><br>Ch 3</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../heacon.html#heacon">     Thermodynamics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
