He reproduced the surface curvature of the thick lens in sections, maintaining the same focal length with a fraction of the weight.    The <a href="foclen.html#c2">lens strength</a> in diopters is defined as the inverse of the focal length in meters. </p><p>Besides the glass Fresnel lenses you see in old lighthouses, large Fresnel lenses made from molded plastic are used for certain focusing tasks. The optical quality is not sufficient for good imaging because of the scattering you get at the junctions between the curved segments, resulting in rings of light in the image plane. </p></td></tr></table><p>The principal <a href="foclen.html#c1">focal length</a> of a lens is determined by the <a href="refr.html#c2">index of refraction </a> of the <a href="glass.html#c1">glass</a>, the radii of curvature of the surfaces, and the medium in which the lens resides. It can be calculated from the <a href="lenmak.html#c1">lens-maker's formula</a> for thin lenses. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="lenscon.html#c1">Lens concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../ligcon.html#c1">     Light and Vision </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
