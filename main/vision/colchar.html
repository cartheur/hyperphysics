The terms "red" and "blue" are primarily describing hue - hue is related to wavelength for <a href="specol.html#c1">spectral colors</a>. It is convenient to arrange the saturated hues around a <a href="newtcol.html#c1">Newton Color Circle</a>. Starting from red and proceeding clockwise around the circle below to blue proceeds from long to shorter wavelengths. However it shows that not all hues can be representedby spectral colors since there is no single wavelength of light which has the magenta hue - it may be produced by an equalmixture of red and blue. </p><table><tr><td><img src="imgvis/hue.gif"></td><td><p>There are many different mixtures of wavelengths which canproduce the same perceived hue. The achromatic line from black to gray to white through the center of the circle represents light which has no hue.                                                  </p></td><tr></table><table><tr><td><p>The distribution of hue around a circle is used in commercially available paint and pigment mixing guides like the <a href="colwheel.html#c1">Color Wheel</a>.<td> <center><img src="vispic/colwhr.jpg"></center></td></tr></table></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="visioncon.html#c1">Vision concepts</a><br><br><a href="colviscon.html#c1">Color vision</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../ligcon.html#c1">     Light and Vision </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c2"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Saturation</H1> <p>  Saturation, along with <a href="#c1">hue</a> and <a href="#c3">brightness</a> make up the three distinct attributes of <a href="specol.html#c2">color</a>. Pink may be thought of as having the same hue as red but being less saturated. A fully saturated color is one with no mixture of white. A <a href="specol.html#c1">spectral color</a> consisting of only one wavelength is fully saturated,but one can have a fully saturated magenta which is not a spectral color. Quantifying the perception of saturation must take into account the fact that some spectral colors are perceived to be more saturated than others. For example, monochromatic reds and violets are perceived to be more saturated than monochromatic yellows. There are also more perceptably different levels of saturation for some hues - a fact accounted for in the <a href="colsys.html#c1">Munsell</a> colorsystem    </p><table><tr><td><img src="imgvis/hue.gif"></td><td><p>There are many different mixtures of wavelengths which canproduce the same perceived hue.

The mixture of white light with the blue gives a less saturated blue. </td></tr></table><p> One of the features of the commercially available <a href="colwheel.html#c1">Color Wheel</a> is to help visualize the effect of adding white paint or pigment.

The brightness of a colored surface depends upon the <a href="areance.html#c1">illuminance</a> and upon its <a href="../phyopt/reflex.html#c1">reflectivity</a>. Since the perceived brightness is not linearly proportional to the reflectivity, a scale from 0 to 10 is used to represent <a href="bright.html#c1">perceived brightness</a> in color measurement systems like the <a href="colsys.html#c1">Munsell</a> system.
