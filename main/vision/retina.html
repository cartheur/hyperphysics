Photosensitive cells called <a href="rodcone.html#c1">rods and cones</a> in the retina convert incident light energy into signals that are carried to the brain by the optic nerve. In the middle of the retina is a small dimple called the <a href="#c2">fovea</a> or fovea centralis. It is the center of the eye's sharpest vision and the location of most color perception. </p> <center><img src="imgvis/retina.gif"></center><p>"A thin layer (about 0.5 to 0.1mm thick) of light receptor cells covers the inner surface of the choroid. The focused beam of light is absorbed via electrochemical reaction in this pinkish multilayered structure. The human eye contains two kinds of photoreceptor cells; rods and cones. Roughly 125 million of them are intermingled nonuniformly over the retina. The ensemble of rods(each about 0.002 mm in diameter in some respects has the characteristics of a high-speed, black and white film(such as Tri-X). It is exceedingly sensitive, performing in light too dim for the cones to respond to, yet it is unable to distinquish color, and the images it relays are not well defined."(Hecht)</p><p>"In contrast, the ensemble of 6 or 7 million cones (each about 0.006 mm in diameter) can be imagined as a separate, but overlapping, low-speed color film. It performs in bright light, giving detailed colored views, but is fairly insensitive at low light levels."(Hecht)"</p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="visioncon.html#c1">Vision concepts</a><br><br><a href="imagformcon.html#c1">Image formation concepts</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="../optics/optref.html#c1">Hecht, 2nd Ed.</a><br>Sec. 5.7</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../ligcon.html#c1">     Light and Vision </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c2"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>The Fovea Centralis</H1> <center><img src="imgvis/fovea.gif"></center> <p>Though the eye receives data from a field ofabout 200 degrees, the acuity over most of thatrange is poor. To form high resolution images, thelight must fall on the fovea, and that limitsthe acute vision angle to about 15 degrees. In low light,this fovea constitutes a second blind spot since it is exclusively cones which have low light sensitivity. At night, to get most acute visionone must shift the vision slightly to one side,say 4 to 12 degrees so that the light falls onsome rods.  </p><p><center>A "dimple on the retina" provides our highest resolution vision.</center></p><p>"Just about at the center of the retina is a small depression from 2.5 to 3 mm in diameterknown as the yellow spot, or macula. There is a tiny rod-free region about 0.3mm in diameterat its center, the fovea centralis. (In comparisonthe image of the full Moon on the retina is about0.2 mm in diameter.) Here the cones are thinner(with diameters of 0.0030mm to 0.0015mm)and more densely packed than anywhere else in the retina. Since the fovea provides thesharpest and most detailedinformation, the eyeball is continuously moving, so that light from the object of primaryinterest falls on this region. ...the rods are multiply connected to nerve fibers, and a single such fiber can be activated by any one of about a hundred rods. By contrast, cones in the fovea are individually connected to nerve fibers. The actual perception of a scene is constructed by the eye-brain system in a continuous analysisof the time-varying retinal image."(Hecht)</TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="visioncon.html#c1">Vision concepts</a><br><br>References<br><a href="../optics/optref.html#c1">Hecht, 2nd Ed.</a><br>Sec. 5.7<br><a href="../optics/optref.html#c1">Williamson & Cummins</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../ligcon.html#c1">     Light and Vision </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c3"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Optic Nerve     </H1><table><tr><td> <p>The optic nerve is the cable of nerve fibers with carries the electrical signals from the <a href="#c1">retina</a> to the brain for processing.
