The graphs of distance, velocity and acceleration as functions of time below were calculated for one-dimensional motion using the motion equations in a spreadsheet. The acceleration does change, but it is constant within a given time segment so that the constant acceleration equations can be used. For variable acceleration (i.e., continuously changing), then <a href="../acons.html#c3">calculus methods</a> must be used to calculate the motion graphs. </p><center><img src="imgmech/positionc.gif"></center><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="#c2">Add annotation about the slopes of the graphs.</a></td></tr></table></center><p>A considerable amount of information about the  motion can be obtained by examining the slope of the various graphs.

The height of the position curve will increase so long as the velocity is constant. As the velocity becomes negative, the position curve drops as the net positive area under the velocity curve decreases. Likewise the height of the velocity curve is a measure of the area under the acceleration curve. The fact that the final velocity is zero is an indication that the positive and negative contributions were equal. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="../mot.html#motcon">Motion concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="vel.html#velcon">Velocity and acceleration</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../hph.html#mechcon">     Mechanics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
