Often the membranes of these structures are lined with <a href="ribosome-2.html#c1">ribosomes</a> on their outer surfaces, giving them a rough appearance.  These parts are called the rough endoplasmic reticulum to contrast them with the smooth endoplasmic reticulum where there are no attached ribosomes.   </p><p>The ribosomes on the rough endoplasmic reticulum manufacture <a href="../organic/protein.html#c1">proteins</a> which enter the channels of the endoplasmic reticulum and move to places where they can create pockets. These pockets can then break off as <a href="vescicle-2.html#c1">vesicles</a> to transport their protein cargo to the <a href="golgi-2.html#c1">Golgi complex</a> for distribution.</p><p>Examples of protein synthesis by the rough endoplasmic reticulum are the proteins produced in secretory cells. These include the digestive <a href="../organic/enzyme.html#c1">enzymes</a> produced in the stomach and the protein hormones like insulin produced in the pancreas. Organ systems which produce many proteins have cells with a large amount of rough endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p>The smooth endoplasmic reticulum plays a major role in synthesizing <a href="../organic/lipid.html#c1">lipids</a> by means of enzymes embedded in these smooth membranes. It produces the <a href="../organic/phoslip.html#c1">phospholipids</a> and <a href="../organic/cholesterol.html#c1">cholesterol</a> used in membrane formation, and along with the membrane proteins produced by the rough ER it can synthesize more membrane for itself, for the Golgi complex, the <a href="celmem-2.html#c1">cell membrane</a>, <a href="lysosome-2.html#c1">lysosomes</a>, and others. </p><p>In liver cells the smooth ER contains enzymes for the detoxification of harmful drugs and metabolic by-products. In the reproductive organs, smooth ER in the cells produces the steroid hormones testosterone and estrogen. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="bioref-2.html#c1">Hickman, et al.</a><br> Ch 4<br><br><a href="bioref-2.html#c1">Audesirk & Audesirk</a><br> Ch 6<br><br><a href="bioref-2.html#c1">Enger & Ross</a><br> Ch 4</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="biocon-2.html#heacon">   Biology </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
