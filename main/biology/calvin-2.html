<HEAD>   <TITLE>The Calvin Cycle</TITLE></HEAD><body bgcolor="#FFE4C8"><!-- Copyright 2008 by Carl Rod Nave, RodNave@gsu.edu--><A Name="c1"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>The Calvin Cycle</H1><center> <img src="imgbio/calvine-2.gif"></center><p>Plants use energy from the sun in tiny energy factories called <a href="chloroplast-2.html#c1">chloroplasts</a>. Using chlorophyll in the process of <a href="photosyn-2.html#c1">photosynthesis</a>, they convert the sun's energy into storable form in ordered <a href="../organic/carb.html#c2">sugar</a> molecules such as <a href="../organic/sugar.html#c1">glucose</a>. In this way, carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil in a more disordered state are combined to form the more ordered sugar molecules.</p><p>Carbon dioxide is captured in a cycle of reactions known as the Calvin cycle or the Calvin-Benson cycle after its discoverers. It is also known as just the C<sub>3</sub> cycle. Those plants that utilize just the Calvin cycle for carbon fixation are known as <a href="phoc-2.html#c1">C3 plants</a>.  Carbon dioxide diffuses into the stroma of chloroplasts and combines with a five-carbon sugar, ribulose1,5-biphosphate (<a href="../organic/rubisco.html#c2">RuBP</a>). The enzyme that catalyzes this reaction is referred to as <a href="../organic/rubisco.html#c1">RuBisCo</a>, a large molecule that may be the most abundant organic molecule on the Earth. This catalyzed reaction produces a  6-carbon intermediate which decays almost immediately to form two molecules of the 3-carbon compound 3-phosphoglyceric acid (<a href="../organic/3pga.html#c1">3PGA</a>). The fact that this 3-carbon molecule is the first stable product of photosynthesis leads to the practice of calling this cycle the C<sub>3</sub> cycle.  </p><table><tr><td><img src="imgbio/calc3-2.gif"></td><td><p>In <a href="phoc-2.html#c1">C3 plants</a> the photosynthesis, carbon fixation and Calvin cycle all occur in a single chloroplast. </p></td></tr></table><table><tr><td><p>In <a href="phoc-2.html#c2">C4 plants</a> the photosynthesis takes place in a chloroplast of a thin-walled mesophyll cell and a 4-carbon acid is handed off to a thick-walled bundle sheath cell where the Calvin cycle occurs in a chloroplast of that second cell. This protects the Calvin cycle from  the effects of <a href="phoc-2.html#c5">photorespiration</a>. </p></td><td><img src="imgbio/calc4-2.gif"></td></tr></table><table><tr><td><img src="imgbio/calcam-2.gif"></td><td><p>In <a href="phoc-2.html#c4">CAM plants</a> the photosynthesis and initial carbon fixation occur at night and a 4-carbon acid is stored in the cell's vacuole. During the day, the Calvin cycle operates in the same chloroplasts. </p></td></tr></table><p>Energy from <a href="atp-2.html#c1">ATP</a> and from the reduced coenyzme <a href="../organic/nad.html#c2">NADPH</a> is used to remove a phosphate group from 3PGA and reduce the resulting diphosphoglycerate (DPGA) to produce the 3-carbon sugar glyceraladehyde-3-phosphate (<a href="../organic/g3p.html#c1">G3P</a>). Some of this G3P is used to regenerate the RuBP  to continue the cycle, but some is available for molecular synthesis and is used to make fructose diphosphate. The fructose diphosphate is then used to make glucose, sucrose, starch and other carbohydrates.</p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="enercyc-2.html#c1">Energy cycle in living things</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br> <a href="psyncon-2.html#c1">Photosynthesis Concepts</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="bioref-2.html#c1">Moore, et al. </a><br>Ch 7</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="biocon-2.html#c1">     Biology </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
