The set of characteristics provided by Audesirk and Audesirk are:</p><ol><li>Animals are multicellular.<li>Animals are heterotrophic, obtaining their energy by consuming energy-releasing food substances.<li>Animals typically reproduce sexually.<li>Animals are made up of cells that do not have cell walls.<li>Animals are capable of motion in some stage of their lives.<li>Animals are able to respond quickly to external stimuli as a result of nerve cells, muscle or contractile tissue, or both. </li></ol><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td>This material is part of a brief overview of the topics studied in biology with the intent to highlight the connections to basic ideas in physics and physical science. </td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="bioref.html#c1">Audesirk & Audesirk</a><br> Ch 22</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="biocon.html#heacon">   Biology </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
