For plant cells, the energy may be obtained from the Sun by <a href="photosyn.html#c1">photosynthesis</a> but for animal cells the energy is obtained from chemical reactions that release energy - that is, the energy is obtained from foods which contain available energy. The typical general reaction that provides energy is the oxidation of <a href="../organic/sugar.html#c1">glucose</a>.</P><center><font size=+2>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub> --> 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O</font></center></sub></p></center>However, even those reactions that release energy (exergonic reactions) usually are not initiated spontaneously but require some activation energy to start them. For the energy-releasing reactions involved in cell <a href="metabolism.html#c1">metabolism</a> to proceed at satisfactory rates under the conditions inside cells, protein catalysts called <a href="../organic/enzyme.html#c1">enzymes</a> are typically required. These enzymes lower the activation energy required. The energy yield from such fuel reactions may be stored in energy-rich molecules like <a href="atp.html#c1">ATP</a> or may be used to provide energy for energy-requiring reactions (endergonic reactions) like those involved in the synthesis of proteins.  Often there are coupled reactions that used the energy from exergonic reactions to fuel specific endergonic synthesis reactions. </p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="enercyc.html#c1">Energy cycle in living things</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="bioref.html#c1">Audesirk & Audesirk</a><br> Ch 4</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="biocon.html#heacon">   Biology </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table> </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
