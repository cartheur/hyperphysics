This path is called the <a href="#c2">ecliptic</a>. It tells us that the Earth's spin axis is tilted with respect to the plane of the Earth's solar orbit by 23.5&#176;. Observations show that the other planets, with the exception of <a href="solar/pluto.html#c1">Pluto</a>, also orbit the sun in essentially the same plane. The ecliptic plane then contains most of the objects which are orbiting the sun.  This suggests that the formation process of the solar system resulted in a disk of material out of which formed the sun and the planets. The 23.5&#176; tilt of the Earth's spin axis gives the <a href="solar/seasons.html#c1">seasonal variations</a> in the amount of sunlight received at the surface. </p></td></tr></table>    <p>Pluto 's orbit is exceptional in that its orbit makes an angle of 17&#176; with the Earth's orbit .

It is often more convenient to describe the apparent motion of sun and stars with respect to the Earth as if it were fixed.

The <a href="#c1">ecliptic plane</a> is inclined at 23.5&#176; with respect to the <a href="#c3">celestial equator</a> because of the tilt of the Earth's rotation axis with respect to the plane of its orbit around the sun. </P></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a  href="grav.html#grvcon">Gravity concepts</a><BR><BR><a  href="orbit.html#orbcon">Orbit concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="hph.html#mechcon">     Mechanics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c7"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Synodic and Sidereal Periods</H1><P>The period of a planet's orbital period around the Sun with respect to the distant stars is called its sidereal period. The sidereal period of the Earth is about 365  1/4 days. Another type of period is useful for viewing the other planets - the period between the times their positions both lie on the same radial line from the sun, called the synodic period. When planets are on the same radial line from the sun, they are said to be "in opposition". For planets closer to the sun than the Earth, the synodic period of the Earth is longer than the sidereal period, and for outer planets it is shorter if seen by an observer on those planets.  </P><p>The sidereal period of Mars is 1.88 years, whereas the synodic period is 2.135 years as seen from the Earth. The time of opposition of Mars is associated with its apparent <a href="solar/retromars.html#c1">retrograde motion</a> for an Earth observer. </p><p>The period which brings the back to the same angular position with respect to the Sun is called the tropical year and is 365.242 mean solar days. Formally this period is defined as the interval of time from one <a href="#c5">vernal equinox</a> to the next. The sidereal period (period with respect to the distant stars) of 365.256 mean solar days is about 20 minutes longer because of the precession of the Earth's spin axis. That precession period of about 26,000 years brings the vernal equinox about 20 minutes earlier each year. The fact that the year is not exactly 365 days has led to the inclusion of the leap year days and other adjustments to the calendar. </p> <p>The sidereal day, which brings a "fixed" star back to the same position on the next night, is 23 hours 56 minutes and 4 seconds. The practical observable effect is that stars rise about 4 minutes earlier each night, about 2 hours earlier in a month, and appear as a parade that progresses westward across the night sky.</p>     </TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a  href="grav.html#grvcon">Gravity concepts</a><BR><BR><a  href="orbit.html#orbcon">Orbit concepts</a><BR><BR>Reference<br><a href="astro/astref.html#c1">Chaisson & McMillan</a><br>Ch 1</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="hph.html#mechcon">     Mechanics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
