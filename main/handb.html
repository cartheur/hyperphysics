If you are dealing with a single object, the concept of balance implies that an object is supported in such a way that its <a href= "mass.html#wgt" >weight</a> does not produce any torque about the point of support. Since the weight can be considered to be concentrated at the <a href= "cm.html#cm" >center of mass</a> for purposes of calculating torque, it follows that in order to have zero torque, the weight must have zero <a href="torq2.html#la">lever arm</a> and that happens only if it is in line with the point of support (directly above or directly below). </p><center><img src="imgmec/hnd1a.gif"></center><p>Common sense tells you to pick up a long board under its center to balance it.
