The center emerald is 45 carats. Many of the gemstones in this necklace date back to the 17th century, when Spanish conquistadors shipped large quantities of emeralds from South America to Europe and Asia. Despite its name, the  necklace has no known association with the infamous Spanish inquisition.</p><p>The large diamond and emerald gems were probably cut in India in the 1600s. Stringing the gems was an extremely delicate procedure that entailed drilling small holes in the large emeralds and the 16 largest diamonds. Legend has it that the  necklace was owned first by Spanish royalty. The Maharajah of Indore acquired it in the early 20th century.</p><table><tr><td><p>Maximilian Emerald Ring</p>This emerald was once set in a ring worn by Mexico's ill-fated emperor, Ferdinand Maximilian Joseph.
