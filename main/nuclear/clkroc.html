The <a href="radser.html#c1">natural radioactive series</a> which involve lead as a daughter element do offer a mechanism to test the assumptions. Common lead contains a mixture of four isotopes. Lead 204, which is not produced by radioactive decay provides a measure of what was "original" lead. It is observed that for most minerals, the proportions of the lead isotopes is very nearly constant, so the lead-204 can be used to project the original quantities of lead-206 and lead-207. (Lead-208 is the final stable product of the <a href="radser.html#c2">Thorium series</a>, so is not used in uranium-lead dating.) The  two uranium-lead dates obtained from U-235 and U-238 have different half-lives, so if the date obtained from the two decays are in agreement, this adds confidence to the date. They are not always the same, so some uncertainties arise in these processes.</p><p>There are  powerful rationales for using lead isotopes as indicative of concentrations at the point when the lead-containing mineral was in the molten state. Since the isotopes of lead are chemically identical, any processes that brought lead into the mineral would be completely indiscriminate about which isotope was brought in. The forming mineral will incorporate lead-204, lead-206 and lead-207 at the ratio at which they are found at that location at the time of formation. Any departure from the original relative concentrations of lead-206 and lead-207 relative to lead-204 could then be attributed to radioactive decay. </p><p>Making use of the decay constants of both <sup>238</sup>U and <sup>235</sup>U, plus the fact that the consistent isotopic ratio of  <sup>238</sup>U/<sup>235</sup>U = 137.88 is found, <a href="hhpb.html#c1">Holmes and Houtermans</a> developed a system to use the ratios of the lead isotopes to produce <a href="PbPb.html#c1">Pb-Pb isochrons</a> for dating minerals.

While there are numerous natural processes that can serve as clocks, there are also many natural processes that can reset or scramble these time-dependent processes and introduce uncertainties. To  try to set a reasonable bound on the age, we could presume that the Earth formed at the same time as the rest of the solar system. If the small masses that become meteorites are part of that system, then a measurement of the solidification time of those meteorites gives an estimate of the age of the Earth. The following illustration points to a scenario for developing such an age estimate.</p><center><img src="imgnuc/agemet.gif"></center><p>Some of the progress in finding very old samples of rock on the Earth are summarized in the following comments.</p><p>  "The oldest rocks on earth that have been dated thus far include 3.4 billion year old granites from the Barberton Mountain Land of South Africa, 3.7 billion year old granites of southwestern Greenland, ..." Levin, 1983</p><p>But later in 1983: "Geologists working in the mountains of western Australia have discovered grains of rock that are 4.1 to 4.2 billion years old, by far the oldest ever found on the Earth" This dating was done on grains of <a href="../minerals/zircon.html#c1">zircon</a>, a mineral so stable that it can retain its identity through volcanic activity, weathering, and sedimentation. It is a compound of zirconium, silicon and oxygen which in its colorless form is used to make brilliant gems. Samples more than 3.5 billion years old have been found in eight or more locations, including Wisconsin, Minnesota, South Africa, Greenland, and Labrador. </p><p>Older ages in the neighborhood of 4.5 billion years are obtained from meteoritic samples. The graph below follows the treatment of Krane of Rb-Sr studies of meteorite samples from Wetherill in order to show the nature of the calculation of age from isochrons.</p><center><table><tr><td><img src="imgnuc/ageearth.gif"></td><td><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="raddat2.html#c2"><center>Show<br>calculation</a></center></td></tr></table></center></td></tr></table></center><p>If you had 100% pure parent element when you began a dating process, then radioactive dating would be extremely reliable since the <a href="halfli2.html#c1">radioactive half-life</a> of a given isotope is quite independent of any natural forces save direct collision-type interactions with the nucleus. Considering the <a href="nucuni.html#c2">relative scale of nuclei and atoms</a>, nuclei are so remote from the outer edge of the atoms that no environmental factors affect them. However, there are two obvious problems with radioactive dating for geological purposes: 1) uncertainty about the composition of the original sample and 2) possible losses of material during the time span of the decay. </p><p>The <a href="#c4">rubidium/strontium dating</a> method deals with both of those difficulties by using the non-radioactive isotope <a href="../pertab/sr.html#c3">strontium-86</a> as a comparison standard. The relative amounts of strontium-87 and -86 are determined with great precision and the fact that the data fits a straight line is a strong argument that none of the constituents was lost from the mix during the aging process. </p><p>The 4.5 billion year age for the earth is consistent with the results of the <a href="#c3">potassium/argon</a> and<a href="#c2"> uranium/lead</a> processes. Similar results are also obtained from the study of spontaneous fission events from uranium-238 and plutonium-244. </p><p>One of the standard references for modeling the age of the Earth is G.
