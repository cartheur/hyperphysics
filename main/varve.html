According to Davidson and Wolgemuth "In northern latitudes where lakes freeze over, fine grained particles will settle out in winter, followed by coarser-grained material in spring as ice thaws and increased stream flow carries larger particles into the lake."<p> In other places, varves are produced by annual diatom blooms. "At all times of the year, fine particulate material settles out on the bottom, but during the spring, single-celled organisms with a solid shell rapidly reproduce near the surface of the lake. As they die, the shells rain out onto the lake floor and form a light-colored coating. Each winter-spring cycle produces a dark-light colored sediment couplet, or varve."</p><p>The photo at left shows two core sections of sediment varves. The photo is from  <a href="http://geology.tufts.edu/varves/Geology/deglaciation.asp">Tufts University Glacial Varve Project</a>.</p><p>The graph below is a summary of comparison of carbon-14 activity with tree rings and with lake varves from Lake Steel in Minnesota and Lake Suigetsu in Japan. It was prepared by geologists Davidson and Wolgemuth. From Lake Suigetsu, a sediment core nearly 250 feet in length was collected in 1991. The core contained an uninterrupted sequence of varves with a total count in excess of 100,000! </p></td></tr></table><img src="images2/treevarvdav.gif"><p>The varve data from Lake Suigetsu are from H.
