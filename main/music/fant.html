The peaks in the vowel spectra are called vocal formants. Note the prominent role of the tongue in this process. The jaw position and lips also play a major part. </p><center><img src="imgmus/fantvowred2.gif"></center><p>The sketches are adapted from Gunnar Fant's "Acoustic theory of speech production" and are reportedly sketches taken from x-rays of the head during the production of these sounds. These are the vowels classified as IPA [a], [i], and [u] and roughly correlate with the vowels represented in the <a href="vowel.html#c1">vowel spectra</a> from Benade.  </p><p>Fant produced area functions for these vowels. The presumption is that if tubes were made with these area functions and were excited with a source with a rich harmonic content like the vocal folds, they would produce a sound similar to the vowel sounds. This has been demonstrated in an exhibit at the Exploratorium in San Francisco. </p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="vowel.html#c2"><center>Other examples</center></a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="voicecon.html#c1">Voice concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="musinscon.html#c1">Musical instruments</a><BR><BR>References<br><a href="../sound/souref.html#c1">Fant</a><BR><BR><a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/exhibits/vocal_vowels/vocal_vowels.html"><img src="imgmus/exlnk.gif"><a><br><a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/exhibits/vocal_vowels/vocal_vowels.html">Exploratorium</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../sound/soucon.html">     Sound </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
