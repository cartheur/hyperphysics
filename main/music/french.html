It was made with a flaring bell and  one or two loops. It was made in the  key of F with a length of about 12 ft and in a key of C with about 8ft of length. It became known in England about this time, and they called it the French horn. Starting in the 1710s, adding interchangeable extra crooks allowed a performer to change the length of the horn to alter its pitch. German hornist Anton Joseph Hampel discovered that hand stopping the horn allowed the player a few more notees. Modern French horns have three valves which lower the pitch a semitone, a tone, and three semitones (minor third). By the end of the 19th century, the horn in F had become standard. It is now typically combined with a shorter horn in B-flat to give a better high range. A fourth valve (thumb valve) is used to change between the F and the B-flat horn.</p>      <p>One characteristic of the French horn is the existence of well defined resonances up to the 22nd or beyond, playable up to at least the 16th harmonic, compared to about 9 playable resonances for the trumpet and trombone. The hand closure is also unique; it increases the acoustic mass of the air column and lowers the resonances. It also allows the instrument to produce resonant peaks out to about 1500 Hz, compared to about 750 Hz without hand closure.  </p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="#c3">Resonance curve</a></td><td><a href="#c1">French Horn illustration</a></td></tr></table></center> </TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="brasscon.html#c1">Brass concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="brass.html#c1">Brass instruments</a><BR><BR><a href="musinscon.html#c1">Musical instruments</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../sound/soucon.html">     Sound </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c3"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>French Horn Resonance Data</H1>   <p> Backus' data on the French horn resonances shows that there are a large number of sharp resonances This enables the French horn player to sound notes at higher harmonics than most brass instruments. As with other brass instruments, the lowest resonance is out of tune with the other resonances, and the <a href="brassa.html#c4">pedal tone</a> is necessary if the 1st harmonic of the <a href="brassa.html#c1">resonant sequence</a> is to be sounded. </p><center><img src="imgmus/fres.gif"></center><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="#c1">French Horn illustration</a></td></tr></table></center> </TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="brasscon.html#c1">Brass concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="brass.html#c1">Brass instruments</a><BR><BR><a href="musinscon.html#c1">Musical instruments</a><BR><BR>Reference<br><a href="../sound/souref.html#c1">Backus</a><br>p. 274</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../sound/soucon.html">     Sound </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
