Tocalculate magnetic field from moving charges using Ampere's Law.<li>To understand the concept of induction and calculate induced emf using Faraday's Law<li>To understand the electrical properties of inductors and determine properties of direct current circuits containing them.<li>To determine properties of alternating current circuits containing resistors, capacitors and inductors<li>To describe the nature of light and other electromagnetic waves using concepts such as reflection, refraction, dispersion, diffraction and interference<li>To calculate the properties of lenses and combinations of lenses<li>To understand the concept of relativity and its consequences<li>To understand wave-particle duality and its consequences in areas such as the blackbody radiation, photoelectric effect, and atomic spectra</ul><P>Textbook: Serway &amp; Beichner, Physics for Scientists and Engineers, 5thEd. We will cover chapters 23-40 as shown on the class schedule. This is a generic course schedule; the actual calendar schedule will be determined by the instructor.</p><p><b>Prerequisites</b>:Math 2211 and Math 2212 or equivalent.</p><p><b>Laboratory</b>: All labs are held in Room 210 of the Science Center. Manuals must be purchased at the Prinshop, 6 Decatur St. Your lab grqde will be the average of your best 12 lab scores. In order to pass the course you must perform and turn in acceptable write-ups on time for at least ten labs.</p><p><b>Grading</b>: Laboratory is 25% of course grade. Values of all other parts of the course (e.g. exams, quizzes, homework) are determined by the instructor.</p><br><br>Return to schedule: <A HREF="p2212.html#c1">     Physics 2212K </A><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;</BODY>
