An electron, a photon, and a proton are each given an energy of 2GeV (kinetic energy for the particles.)<BR>&nbsp;Find the deBroglie wavelength associated with each. Which ofthe particles is most relativistic? Show<BR>your criteria for your answer.<P>w=hc/pc= 1240ev nm/mc<BR>For electron, pc= sqrt((2000+.555)^2-.511^2) =&nbsp;&nbsp; 2000.55MeV, so you could have just used pc=E<BR>w = 1240 MeV fm/2000.55 Mev=&nbsp; 0.6198 fm<P>For proton, pc=sqrt((2000+938)^2-938^2)=&nbsp;&nbsp; 2784.2 MeV<BR>w = 1240 MeV fm/2784.24 Mev=&nbsp; 0.4453 fm<P>For photon, pc=E, so w = 1240MeV fm/2000 MeV=&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.62 fm<BR>&nbsp;<P>2. In order to probe the structure of the atom, it is reasonable to&nbsp;have a wavelength about a tenth of the<BR>size of the atom, say 0.03 nm.<BR>Find the necessary energies for protons, electrons and photons to achievethis wavelength.<P>For photon, pc=E, pc = 1240 eV nm/.03 nm =&nbsp;&nbsp; 41333. eV<P>pc is the same for the other particles, so just the energy must be calculated.<BR>For the proton,&nbsp; KE = sqrt((.041333)^2+938^2)-938 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.10E-07 MeV<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp; 0.91 eV<BR>For the electron,&nbsp; KE = sqrt((.041333)^2+.511^2)-.511 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.001668 MeV<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1669 eV<P>3. It turns out that electrons are the most versatile probe of nuclearstructure since they are attracted<BR>rather than repelled, and&nbsp; they do not break down into anythingsmaller.<P>a. Suppose you want to probe to one tenth the size of a hydrogen nucleus,radius 1.2 fm.&nbsp; What energy<BR>electrons would be necessary?<P>For electron, pc = 1240 MeV fm/.12 fm =&nbsp;&nbsp; 10333.

Suppose at a much larger scale, you want to examine the lattice geometryof a crystal where the<BR>separation between atomic planes is 1.2 nm. If you want the electronto have a deBroglie wavelength twice<BR>&nbsp;the lattice spacing, what energy electrons would be necessary?<P>For electron, pc = 1240 eV nm/2.4 nm =&nbsp;&nbsp; 516.6 eV<BR>For the electron,&nbsp; KE = sqrt((516.66)^2+511000^2)-511000 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.261 eV<BR>&nbsp;<P>4. A color television electron gun gives the electrons about 23000 eVof energy. The electrons have to go<BR>through apertures of diameter 0.5mm in the metal picture tube maskin order to hit the correct phosphor<BR>dot. If the uncertainty in energy is 100 eV, what is the correspondinguncertainty in position given by<BR>the uncertainty principle?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>pc=sqrt((23050+511000)^2-511000^2)=&nbsp;&nbsp; 155204. eV<BR>pc=sqrt((22950+511000)^2-511000^2)=&nbsp;&nbsp; 154859. eV<BR>delta pc =&nbsp;&nbsp; 344.4 eV<BR>delta x = hbar c/2 delta pc = 1240 eVnm/4*PI()*344 eV =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.286 nm<P>So the position uncertainty for the electrons is down at atomic dimensions,so you don't have to<BR>worry about quantum properties of the electron for the color tv application.<P>5. If the uncertainty in momentum Dp is taken&nbsp; to be equal to themomentum p, a common presumption<BR>for central force problems, then, using the uncertainty principle inone dimension<P>a.

A radioactive source sends a million alphas per second toward a 1x10-6m gold foil. A graduate student<BR>watches a 4 cm2 area of scintillator screen for flashes indicatingthe impace of an alpha. The screen is<BR>centered at angle 30&deg; at a distance of 20 cm from the foil so thatit covers angles from 27&deg; to 33&deg;.
