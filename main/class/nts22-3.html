How could you measure the friction coefficient? If you exert just enough force overcome friction and start something in motion, do you have to push with that same force to keep it going at a constant speed? </p><br><p>Describe Newton's Laws and their applications to motion.</p><p>Given F=ma, calculate the motion of an object</p><p>If a 5 kg object is acted upon by a force of 20 N,what is its acceleration?
