Circuits</H1>Reference: Simpson, Ch 2, Appendices A , C, & E<p>Objective:  To provide experience with A.C. Ohm's law, to demonstrate thefrequency dependence of reactance and impedance, and to investigate theproperties of simple filter circuits.</p><p>Procedure:  All the voltages in this experiment will be measured using theoscilloscope, while the frequencies will be measured with the counter.  Besure its vertical gain control is in the calibrated position.  Refer to theprevious description.</p><p>I.Capacitive Reactance<br>A.  Set up the circuit shown in <a href="p3500Lab2f1.html">Figure 1</a> after using the impedance bridge and ohmmeter to determine the values of the components you are using. <ul><li>Be sure both your signal generator, oscilloscope and counter areplugged into the wall with 3-prong adaptors.  Otherwise, thereis an "invisible" connection between their black or "ground"terminals through the 3rd prong.  If this connection exists,your readings will not be accurate.  You can test for this effectby connecting the oscilloscope to the signal generator in bothpossible ways.  The wave form should be the same amplitude inboth cases.</li></ul></p><p>B. At each of 10 different frequency settings between 1 kilohertzand 100 kilohertz (1,2,4,7,10,20,40,70,100kHz), set <img src="vg.gif"> (the output voltage of the signal generator) to 2.00 <img src="vpp.gif"> as measured by the oscilloscope and thenmeasure and record along with the frequency the peak-to-peakvoltages for <img src="vr.gif">  and <img src="vc.gif"> (the voltages across R, C, and thegenerator).  Make all three measurement at the same frequencybefore going to another, and make them without changing thegenerator amplitude setting. </p><p>C. Results and Analysis<ol><li>Calculate the capacitive reactance at each frequencyaccording to <img src="xcvi.gif">.  Since R and C are in series,the same current flows through each.  Thus <img src="icir.gif">.Make two cartesian graphs: one of <img src="xc.gif"> as a function of f (e.g., f is horizontal and <img src="xc.gif"> is vertical) and one of <img src="xc.gif">as a function of l/f.  Whysuggest using l/f?  Are the results reasonable?  Why? </li>       <li>Based on your reactance results, calculate the capacitance and compare it to the actual value. </li>         <li>  A.C. Ohm's law<ul><li>Note that for each frequency setting <img src="vrvc.gif">.Is this a violation of Kirchoff's laws as learned inconnection with D.C. circuits?

Set up the circuit shown in <a href="p3500Lab2f2.html">Figure 2</a> (your results will be best if itis wired exactly as shown):</p><p>B. For 10 frequencies between 2KHz and 40KHz, measure and record thepeak-to-peak voltage for V and V</p><p>Note:  You should observe the VÃ to go through a definite peak (about afactor of VÃ) over this range.  If you observe no suchbehavior, or if your peak is less pronounced, consult the supervisor.</p><p>C. Graph VÃ over the range.  The spread of the peak is related to the "Q"of the circuit, while the frequency of the greatest voltage is theresonant frequency.  From your graph, estimate the resonant frequencyand compare it with the value computed from theoreticalconsiderations.</p><p>D.ÂNote that the sum of the values VÃ at any frequency setting. Explain why this is not a violation of Kirchoff's law of voltages.</p><p>E. Rearrange the circuit so that the capacitor and inductor are adjacentas shown below:Æ(#Connect the signal generator as indicated by VÃ, and observe thevoltage VÃ as the frequency is adjusted over the 2©20 KHz range. Describe qualitatively what you see.  At the frequency of minimumVÃ, observe the value of VÃ.  Explain why VÃ alone is much greaterthan VÃ</p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="lab2.html">Sample data and setup</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66"><a href="../../hframe.html">Index</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<A HREF="../../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="p3500-2.html">     Physics 3500 </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
