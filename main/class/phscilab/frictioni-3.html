Then when the block starts to move, it usually takes less force to keep the block in motion at a constant speed. The maximum force at the point at which the block starts to move, and the force required to keep in constant velocity motion are characterized by static and kinetic coefficients of friction. These coefficients are just the applied forces under those two conditions divided by the force pressing the surfaces together.</p><p>1. Place the wooden track horizontally on the table, attach a string and weight hanger as indicated. Placing a wooden block at some point near the end of the board , find out how much mass must be added to start the block in motion from rest. Then find the mass of the block and the coefficient of static friction. Note: in all your measurements of the amount of hanging mass, be sure to include the  mass of the hanger, which is typically 50 grams.</p><center><img src="frict3-2.gif"></center>       <p> Note that <font face="symbol">m</font><sub>s</sub> is a ratio of forces which are determined by the weights of the blocks, but since the masses are also proportional to the weights, the coefficient of friction is</p><center><img src="frict6.html"></center><p>2. Using the same setup, give the block a slight push on each trial and find out how much hanging mass is required to maintain the block in motion at a constant velocity. You will have to make a judgment by watching the motion to find the proper hanging mass so that, once bumped into motion, the block moves without speeding up or slowing down.</p>	<table><tr><td>mass added ________________________</td></tr></table>	<table><tr><td>coefficient </td><td><img src="muk-2.gif"> </td><td> = ____________________</td></tr></table><p>3. You now have some experience with how much mass it takes to put the block in motion. Choose a convenient mass significantly above that threshold mass, like the nearest 100 grams above the amount required to put it in motion. Place the block on the wooden track at about the same starting point and suspend the hanging mass at a height so that it can hit the floor and such that the wooden block will move and stop without hitting the pulley. Practice a bit until you have an experimental setup which works.<table><tr><td>Hanging  mass ________________</td><td>Height of mass _______________</td</tr><tr><td>Time to floor  ________________</td><td>Distance block moved _______________</td</tr></table><p>Before you released the hanging mass, it had <a href="../../gpot.html#mgh">potential energy</a> equal to its weight (mg) times its height from the floor. Evaluate that initial potential energy by converting the mass to kilograms, using 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup> for g, and multiplying times the initial height in meters.</p><table><tr><td><p>Initial potential energy PE = mgh = ____________ joules. <p>Evaluate the final kinetic energy of the hanging mass, KE = 0.5 mv<sup>2</sup> just before it hits the floor</p><p>Distance = ________ meters, time = ___________ s, average velocity = __________m/s</p><p>Final velocity __________ m/s, <br><br>KE = 0.5 mv<sup>2</sup> = _____________ joules.</p></td><td><center><img src="imglab/frictenergy-3.gif"></center></td></tr></table><p>How does your measured <a href="../../ke.html#ke">kinetic energy</a> compare with the original potential energy? Does this make sense in light of the conservation of energy principle? Why is the KE less than the PE?</p><p>Now examine the amount of <a href="../../work2.html#wsl">work done</a> on the block. If the block moves and then stops on the horizontal surface, then its initial and final kinetic energies are zero. That means that the work done on it by the falling mass was counteracted by friction so that all the energy supplied to the block is dissipated by friction. The work done against friction is equal to the difference between the potential and kinetic energies you measured above.</p><center><p>Work against friction = force of friction x distance = <font size="+1"><font face="symbol">m</font> m<sub>block</sub> g d<sub>block</sub></font></center><p>Setting the work done by friction against the  motion equal to the work done on the block by the falling mass allows you to get another evaluation of the coefficient of friction <font size="+1"><font face="symbol">m</font> </font> since you now know all the other parameters in the above equation.</p><p>Work done on block by falling mass = ______________ joules.</p><p> Coefficient of friction = ______________. </p><p>Is this coefficient of friction closer to your static or kinetic friction coefficients from above?
