One way to do this is to repeat measurementsand average the results. The maximum deviation from the average is oneway to assess uncertainty (although not the best way). In the followingmeasurements, measure each case at least three times and take an average.Then record the number like the following example.</p><P><table><tr><td>Measured times:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td> 5.6 sec<BR>6.0 sec<BR>6.2 sec<BR>Sum 17.8 sec&nbsp; &divide; 3 = 5.9 sec average</td></tr></table><P>Experimental time: 5.9 &plusmn; 0.3 sec since the maximum deviationfrom the average is 0.3 sec.<br><br>(Checking one-by-one: 5.9-5.6 = 0.3,  5.9-6.0 = -.1,  5.9-6.2 = -.3, so the biggest difference has a size 0.3 . Using this maximum deviation from your average as your estimate of measurement uncertainty gives you a sort of "worst case" estimate of the uncertainty of your measurement.)<P>1. Start and stop the stopwatch as quickly as you can. This will giveyou a measure of your reaction time.<P><table><tr><td>Reaction time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td><td>__________<BR> __________<BR> __________</td></tr></table><P>Experimental reaction time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ___________&nbsp; &plusmn;&nbsp;&nbsp;___________ sec.<P>2. Drop the ball provided from a height of one meter and measure thetime required to hit the floor. Find an experimental fall time by the aboveprocedure.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>3. Assemble the track so that the bottom of the ball in its startingposition may be positioned 2 cm above the flat surface (basically, thiswill mean just sitting the end of the track on top of the supporting block).Let the ball roll down the incline and measure the time when it leavesthe track at the bottom end. Measure the lengthof the track so that you may calculate the average speed.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>4. Will doubling the height of the upper end of the incline cut the time in half? Measureit and find out.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>5. What height will cut the roll time in half? Experiment and find out.Record the height and the times for your closest approach to half the timein part 3.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>6.
