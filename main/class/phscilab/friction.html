Place the block on the incline and slowly tilt the incline until the block starts to slide from rest. Then obtain the coefficient of static friction as illustrated.</p><center><img src="frict2.gif"></center><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="frictapp.html#c1">Apparatus Movie</a></td></tr></table></center><p>Placing the block at the same point on the incline, repeat the procedure to get three values for ms and then average the values.</p>	<center><img src="fricts.gif"></center><p>2. With repeated trials, elevate the incline from the horizontal and give the block a slight push to get it into motion. Find the angle at which the block neither speeds up or slows down, but moves down the incline at a constant velocity. (You are using your eye for judgement, and nonuniformity of the surface will affect this judgement, so the value obtained is not very accurate.) Find the coefficient of friction as above. This time it is the coefficient of moving or 'kinetic' friction.</p>		<center><img src="frict4.gif"></center><p>3. Placing the incline horizontally on the table, attach a string and weight hanger as indicated. Using about the same point on the board as in part 1, find out how much mass must be added to start the block in motion from rest. Then find the mass of the block and the coefficient of static friction. </p><center><img src="frict3.gif"></center>       <p> (Note that ms is a ratio of forces which are determined by the weights of the blocks, but since the masses are also proportional to the weights, the coefficient of friction </p><center><img src="frict6.gif"></center><p>4. Using the same setup, give the block a slight push on each trial and find out how much hanging mass is required to maintain the block in motion at a constant velocity.</p>	<table><tr><td>mass added ________________________</td></tr></table>	<table><tr><td>coefficient </td><td><img src="muk.gif"> </td><td> = ____________________</td></tr></table><p>5.
