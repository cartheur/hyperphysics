Be able to fill in quantities in the <a href="../units.html#uni2">chain of mechanical quantities</a>.<br>&nbsp;<p>2. A ball is thrown straight upward with an initial velocity of 40 m/s.After two seconds of flight, it will have a velocity of about<br>a. 0 m/s<br>b. 60 m/s<br><b><font size="+1"><a href="../traj.html#tra1">c. 20 m/s</a></b></font><br>d. can't be determined<p>and an acceleration of about<p>a. 10 m/s2 upward<br><b><font size="+1"><a href="../traj.html#tra1">b. 10 m/s2 downward</a></b></font><br>c. zero, weightless condition<br>d. less than 10 m/s2 because it has slowed down<p>3. A Mack truck and a Honda Civic&nbsp; traveling at the same speedcollide head-on. The impact force is greatest on the<br>a. Honda Civic&nbsp; <b><font size="+1"><a href="../truckc.html#c1">c. ...is the same for both</a></b></font><br>b. Mack truck<p>4. A Mack truck and a Honda Civic traveling at the same speed have ahead-on collision. The vehicle to undergo the greatest acceleration willbe the<br><b><font size="+1"><a href="../truckc.html#c1">a. Honda Civic </a></b></font>&nbsp; c. both the same<br>b. Mack truck<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<p>5. A ball rolls down an incline from rest to a distance of 4 metersin 2 seconds. The average velocity is<br><b><font size="+1"><a href="../mot.html#mot1">a. 2 m/s</a></b></font><br>b. 0.5 m/s<br>c. 1/8&nbsp; m/s<br>d. 8 m/s<p>6. If the acceleration is constant, the final velocity at the end ofthe roll above would be expected to be<br><b><font size="+1"><a href="../mot.html#mot1">a. 4 m/s</a></b></font><br>b. 1 m/s<br>c. 16 m/s<br>d. 2 m/s<p>7. A net force of 40 newtons acts on a 2 kg block and moves it 4 metersin the direction of the force. The work done on the block is<br>a. 80 joules<br><b><font size="+1"><a href="../work2.html#wsl">b. 160 joules</a></b></font><br>c. 320 joules<br>d. 1600 joules<p>8. A car crashes into a barrier and is brought to a sudden stop. Tominimize the impact force on the car<br>a. the car should be build solidly so that it does not collapse<br><b><font size="+1"><a href="../carcr.html#cc3">b. the car should be build in such a way to give maximum collapse onimpact.</a></b></font><br>c. nonsense! the impact force just depends on how fast you were going.<p>because<br><b><font size="+1"><a href="../carcr.html#cc3">a. increasing the distance traveled during an impact decreases theforce of impact.</a></b></font><br>b. increasing the distance traveled during an impact increases theforce of impact.<br>c. the force of impact is independent of the distance traveled duringimpact.<p>9. A woman on the surface of the Earth has a mass of 50 kilograms anda weight of 490 newtons. If the woman were floating freely inside a spacehabitat far away from Earth, she would have<br>a. less weight and more mass<br><b><font size="+1"><a href="../mass.html#wgt">b. less weight and the same mass.</a></b></font><br>c. less weight and less mass<br>d. more weight and less mass.<br>e. none of these.<p>10. If you mass a rock in air and find its mass to be 45 grams, andthen mass it while submerged in water (density 1 gm/cm3) and find its apparentmass to be 30 grams, then the density of the rock is<p>a. 1.5 gm/cm3<br><b><font size="+1"><a href="../pbuoy2.html#arc">b. 3 gm/cm3</a></b></font><br>c. 2 gm/cm3<br>d. can't be determined with this data<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<p>11. For an elliptical planetary orbit, the sun is located at<p>a.&nbsp; the center of the ellipse.<br><b><font size="+1"><a href="../kepler.html#c2">b. one focus of the ellipse.</a></b></font><br>c.&nbsp; the perigee point of the ellipse.<br>d.&nbsp; the apogee point on the ellipse.<p>12. Newton's Second Law of Motion connected the action of a "force"with a resulting "acceleration".&nbsp; What property of an object influenceshow large that acceleration will be?<p>a.&nbsp; weight<br>b.&nbsp; volume<br>c.&nbsp;&nbsp; speed<br><b><font size="+1"><a href="../newt.html#fma">d.&nbsp; mass</a></b></font><br>e. density<p>13. Johannes Kepler developed his laws of planetary motion bases inthe motion of which planet?<p>a.&nbsp; Venus<br><b><font size="+1">b.&nbsp; Mars</b></font><br>c.&nbsp; Jupiter<br>d.&nbsp; Neptune<p>14.&nbsp; In which constellation would you find mars tonight?<p>a. Sagittarius<br>b. Antares<br><b><font size="+1">c. Scorpius</b></font><br>d. Lyra<p>15.&nbsp; In general planets appear to move in which direction amongthe stars?<p>a.&nbsp; north<br>b.&nbsp; south<br>c.&nbsp; east<br>d.&nbsp; west<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="nts3001-4.html#c1">     NSCI 3001</A></body>
