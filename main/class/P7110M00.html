The moon does not fall to the earth because</P><P>a. the net force on it is zero</P><P>b. it is being pulled by the sun and planets as well as the earth</P><P>c. it is beyond the pull of the earth's gravity</P><P>d. ... but it does fall!</P><P>More specifically , the moon</P><P>e. is subject to both centripetal and centrifugal forces</P><P>f. interacts with all massive bodies, both near and far with similar strengths</P><P>g. is free of air resistance as well as other earthly influences</P><P>h falls away from the straight line it would follow if there were no gravity. </P><P>4. The body chiefly responsible for ocean tides is the</P><P>a. moon</P><P>b. sun</P><P>chiefly because</P><P>c. the moon is closer to the earth than the sun and pulls it harder</P><P>d. gravitational pull by the moon is less than that of the sun</P><P>e. the difference between the moon's pull on the near and far sides of the earth is appreciable</P><P>5. Picking up a weight which is far out in front of you is bad for the back principally because</P><P>a. you may fall on your nose</P><P>b. the weight has a long lever arm while your back muscles have a very short lever arm to produce a balancing torque.</P><P>c. the torque exerted by the weight is greater than that exerted by the back muscles.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>6.

The force with which the earth is attracted toward the person is</P><P>a. 500 N</P><P>b. infinitesimally small</P><P>c. billions and billions of tons</P><P>principally because</P><P>d. both forces in question make an action/reaction pair</P><P>e. the mass of the person is negligible compared to the mass of the earth</P><P>f. the earth itself weighs billions of tons</P><P>g. of inertia</P><P>7.

A car increases its speed from 60 to 65 miles per hour in the same time that a bicycle increases its speed from rest to 5 miles per hour. In this case the acceleration is greatest for the </P><P>a. car</P><P>b. bicycle</P><P>c. ... is the same for each</P><P>principally because</P><P>d. the car undergoes the greatest changes in velocity</P><P>e. the bicycle has considerably less mass</P><P>f. both undergo equal increases in speed during the same time interval</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>12. A ball is dropped.

Ball B</P><P>c. both will hit at the same time</P><P>The reason for this is because </P><P>d. ball A has a lesser distance to travel</P><P>e. ball B is acted upon by an additional force</P><P>f. both balls fall the same vertical distance with equal acceleration</P><P>19. If one doubles the speed of a moving body, one also doubles its</P><P>a. acceleration</P><P>b. momentum</P><P>c. kinetic energy</P><P>d. potential energy</P><P>e. energy</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>20.
