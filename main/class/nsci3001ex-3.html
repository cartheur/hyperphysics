Their intent is to show you a range of numericalanswers associated with different physical phenomena; these are the typeof calculations which are carried out in the problem-solving type physicscourses. In the case of these exercises, the actual calculations are doneby the computer but it is hoped that the exercises will help you becomeaccustomed to the computer as a tool and a source of information.</p><P>Note about entering numbers in calculations: When you enter a numberin one of the calculations in HyperPhysics, you then just click anywhereoutside the box to make sure the transaction is complete and the numberis taken. If you need to edit the number, it is usually easiest to justdouble-click in the data entry box. That will turn the field dark, andany number you type will replace the previous number.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>Exercise 1: <a href="../traj.html#tra1">Vertical Motion</a><P>The items which you can change are in the boxes (launch speed and time).You can calculate the height and speed at any time, and the peak heightassociated with your chosen launch velocity is displayed.<P>1.
