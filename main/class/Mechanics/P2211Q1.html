If a ball is thrown straight downward with an initial speed of<BR>5 m/s, find its distance, velocity, and acceleration 3 seconds later.Neglect air friction, and assume that no forces other than gravity acton the ball.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>2. The acceleration of a 2 kg mass in the x direction is given by<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a = 12t2.<P>a. Find the expression for its velocity as a function of time and findthe velocity at 4 seconds.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>b. Find the expression for its x position as a&nbsp; function of timeand its value at 4 seconds.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>3. A force of 10 Newtons is exerted at an angle of 37&deg; from thex axis, and a 20 Newton force is exerted at 53&deg;. These forces are exertedon a 4 kg mass.<BR>a. Find the magnitude and direction of the resultant force on the 4kg mass.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>b. Find the acceleration of the mass.<BR>&nbsp;<P>4. A ball is launched with an initial velocity of 100 m/s at an angleof 37&deg;. It is launched over level ground from zero height. What isits height at time 2 seconds?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>5. A 5 kg block is placed on an incline which makes an angle of 37&deg;with the horizontal.<P>a. If the incline is frictionless, what is the acceleration of the massdown the incline?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>b. If the incline has a coefficient of friction m = 0.2, what wouldbe the frictional force which would resist the&nbsp; motion of the massdown the incline?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>6. Suppose you could swing a 5 kg mass around in a horizontal circleon a frictionless surface with a rope. What tension in the rope would berequired to swing the mass in a 2 meter circle at 8 m/s constant speed?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>7. You are holding a 4 kg mass, hanging on a rope. With what verticalforce must you pull on the rope to accelerate the mass upward at 4 m/s2?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>8. A 20 kg mass sits on a surface with coefficient of friction 0.1.A force of 35 N is exerted on the box at an angle of 37&deg; upward abovethe horizontal. What is the acceleration of the mass?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>9. A 4 kg mass sits on a horizontal frictionless table and another 4kg mass is tied to it by a string and suspended over a pulley. Find theacceleration of the hanging mass.<BR>&nbsp;</BODY>
