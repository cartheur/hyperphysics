The reflected beam from the beam splitter was pointed into one hole onthe light sensor.  The other beam was reflected off a mirror, and returned to the otherhole on the light sensor.  A lens with a focal length of approximatel six inches wasused to focus the beam into the hole.  An ocilloscope was used to read the differencebetween the two beams.  Set at 0.5 volts per division, 820 Hertz, and a time interval of1 ms, the waves were off by approximately 0.2 divisions.  Using the equation given inthe lab instructions, and the fact that the total distance traveled by the light was17.48 meters, our value for the speed of light came out to 6.78 x 10^8 meters persecond.</p><p>Experimenters:   Theresa Crider-Cox, Steve Gerber </p><br><br><a href="p391-2.html">Physics 3901 </a><BR>&nbsp;</BODY>
