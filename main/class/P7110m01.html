A horse exerts 500 N of force on a heavy wagon. The wagon pulls backon the horse with an equal force. The wagon still accelerates because<BR>a. these forces are not an action-reaction pair<BR>b. nevertheless there is still an unbalanced force on the wagon<BR>c. the horse pulls on the wagon a brief time before the wagon reacts<BR>d. ...the wagon does not accelerate because these forces are equaland opposite<BR>e. none of these<P>5.

When a bullet is fired from a rifle, the force on the rifle is equalto the force on the bullet.

A popular swinging-balls apparatus consists of an aligned row ofidentical elastic balls that are suspended by strings so they barely toucheach other.
