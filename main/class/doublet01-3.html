(diagram 1)<P>&nbsp;First problem during alignment:&nbsp; three laser-like dots appearedon the viewing screen.&nbsp; To correct this issue an ground glass platewas placed between the laser and the first contact lens.<P>&nbsp;The next issue occurred when attempting to resolve the doubletsin the "bulls eye" circular pattern.&nbsp; Eventually all members vieweddoublet separation. (Diagram 2)&nbsp; The problem occurred from over compensationof the interferometers distance.&nbsp; Minute adjustments had to be madewith the spring-loaded knobs on the face plate.<P>Lab 2 &shy; 9/7/01<P>&nbsp;Upon zeroing the F-P interferometer, it was observed that by turningthe measurement dial entirely to the left, 35mm, the doublets were clearlyseen.<P>&nbsp;All members took readings of separation distance from the zeromark, at 35mm, the doublets were clearly seen.<P>&nbsp;A problem occurred when the adjusting knob on the interferometerfastened itself to the stationary inner cylinder used to take measurements.This was overcome with the use of several various tools and non-tools toloosen and refasten to the interferometer.<P>&nbsp;Another issue that was observed was that the lower fire adjustingknob had the washer stripped and would not be able to move.Diagram 2<table><tr><td>Number<td>Name<td>x1<td>x2<td>Delta x<tr><td>1<td>Alan<td>5.0<td>34.5<td>29.5<tr><td>2<td>Alan<td>34.5<td>16.4<td>18.1<tr><td>3<td>Alan<td>4.4<td>34.6<td>30.2<tr><td>1<td>Jay<td>3.2<td>31.2<td>28.0<tr><td>2<td>Jay<td>31.2<td>13.7<td>32.5<tr><td>3<td>Jay<td>6.5<td>35.2<td>28.7<tr><td>1<td>John<td>0.0<td>30.4<td>30.4<tr><td>2<td>John<td>30.4<td>13.6<td>33.2<tr><td>3<td>John<td>3.0<td>34.0<td>31.0</td></tr></table><P>Avg  of all&nbsp;<P>30.66<center><img src="labpic/hdtubemount-2.jpg"></center><br><center><table><tr><td><img src="labpic/hdfringe-2.jpg"></td><td><img src="labpic/hdspect2-2.jpg"></td></tr></table></center>Experimenters: Alan Diaz, Jay Dunn, John Marshall<br><br><a href="p391-2.html">Physics 3901 </a><BR>&nbsp;</BODY>
