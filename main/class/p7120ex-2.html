Their intent is to show you a range of numericalanswers associated with different physical phenomena; these are the typeof calculations which are carried out in the problem-solving type physicscourses. In the case of these exercises, the actual calculations are doneby the computer but it is hoped that the exercises will help you becomeaccustomed to the computer as a tool and a source of information.<P>You will be informed in class about when exercises are due to be turnedin. They will be logged and returned to you. It would be a good idea towork on the exercises as soon as we have covered the material in classso you won't have to do them all in a rush when they are called for.<P>A link to the exercises may be found in the right-hand column on thePhysics 7120 Calendar. Links in the exercises will take you to the calculationin HyperPhysics.<P>Note about entering numbers in calculations: When you enter a numberin one of the calculations in HyperPhysics, you then just click anywhereoutside the box to make sure the transaction is complete and the numberis taken. If you need to edit the number, it is usually easiest to justdouble-click in the data entry box. That will turn the field dark, andany number you type will replace the previous number.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>Exercise 1: <a href="../wavrel.html#c2">Wave calculation</a><P>1. What is the wavelength in meters of the electromagnetic carrier wavetransmitted by the radio station WSB AM at 750 kHz? 1 kHz =10<sup>3</sup> Hz and thespeed of light is 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> m/s.<P>2. What is the wavelength in meters of the electromagnetic carrier wavetransmitted by GSU's WRAS at 88.5 MHz ? 1 MHz = 10<sup>6</sup> Hz<P>3. If a sound is produced at the orchestra standard frequency of 440Hz, at a temperature where the speed of sound is 345 m/s, what is the wavelengthof the sound produced?<P>4. If the limits of human hearing are 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz, what are thesound wavelengths associated with these extremes. You may use 345 m/s forthe speed of sound.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>Exercise 2: <a href="../waves/opecol2.html#c1">Open air column resonance</a><BR>1. If a flute constitutes an open air column, how long must the aircolumn be if it is to produce a frequency at middle-C, 261 Hz?<BR>&nbsp;<P>2. An open-ended organ pipe is to be constructed to sound the note A=55 Hz, one octave above the bottom note on the piano. How long must theair column be?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>Exercise 3: <a href="../waves/clocol.html#c2">Closed air column resonance</a><P>1. A clarinet acts as a closed-ended air column. If its bottom notehas a frequency of 130 Hz, how long is the column?<P>2. The ear canal responds most strongly to frequencies around 3700 Hzbecause that is the lowest resonant frequency of the canal. If the canalacts like a closed-ended cylinder, how long is the ear canal?<P>3. If the top resonance of the <a href="../waves/clocol2.html#c2">water tube resonance unit</a> is at a columnlength of 8 cm when a tuning fork of frequency 1024 Hz , what is the correspondingspeed of sound?<BR>&nbsp;<P>Exercise 4: <a href="../geoopt/image.html#c1">Formation of real images</a><BR>1. If a camera lens has a focal length of f = 5 cm, at what image distancefrom the lens must the film be placed to form an image of an object whichis 500 cm from the lens?<P>2. If the object is moved closer to the camera lens ( to 100 cm) whatis the distance to the film from the lens?<P>3. If you want to take a picture of a flower at only 20 cm from thelens, what lens-to-film image distance would be required? (This probablywould require and extension tube).<P>4. In a slide projector the slide is placed very close to the focallength of the lens. If you want to project an image 5 meters away froma f=5cm slide projector lens, where would you have to put the slide (objectdistance)?<BR>&nbsp;<P>Exercise 5: <a href="../geoopt/image3.html#c1">Formation of virtual images</a><P>1. If you are looking through a divergine lens of focal length f = -20cm at an object which is 40 cm away from the lens, at what distance fromthe lens would the image appear to be?<BR>&nbsp;<P>Exercise 6: <a href="../geoopt/image4.html#c1">More virtual images</a><P>If the object distance is smaller than the focal length of&nbsp; a magnifyinglens, then the image will be virtual, on the same side of the lens as theobject and further away.<P>1. If you use a magnifier of focal length f=10 cm to look at an objectwhich is at 5 cm from the lens, where will the image appear to be? Whatwill be the magnification?<P>2. If you put the object closer to the focal length, at 9 cm from thelens, where will the image be and what is its magnification?<P>Exercise 7: <a href="../hyde.html#c4">Atomic Spectra</a><BR>Radiation of all the types in the electromagnetic spectrum can comefrom the atoms of different elements. A rough classification of some ofthe types of radiation by wavelength is:<BR>Infrared&nbsp;&nbsp; > 750 nm<BR>Visible&nbsp;&nbsp; 400 - 750 nm<BR>Ultraviolet&nbsp;&nbsp; 10-400 nm<BR>Xrays&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; 10 nm<BR>(An approximate classification of spectral colors: Violet (380-435nm),Blue(435-500 nm), Cyan (500-520 nm), Green (520-565 nm), Yellow (565- 590nm), Orange (590-625 nm), Red (625-740 nm).<BR>1. If the electron in a hydrogen atom (Z=1) makes a transition fromn=2 to n=1, the wavelength of the radiation will be&nbsp; _______ nm, whichis in the __________ part of the electromagnetic spectrum.<BR>2. If the electron in a hydrogen atom (Z=1) makes a transition fromn=3 to n=2, the wavelength of the radiation will be&nbsp; _______ nm, whichis in the __________ part of the electromagnetic spectrum.<BR>1. If the electron in a hydrogen atom (Z=1) makes a transition fromn=4 to n=3, the wavelength of the radiation will be&nbsp; _______ nm, whichis in the __________ part of the electromagnetic spectrum.<BR>1. If the electron in a oxygen atom (Z=8) makes a transition from n=2to n=1, the wavelength of the radiation will be&nbsp; _______ nm, whichis in the __________ part of the electromagnetic spectrum.<P>Exercise 8: <a href="../nuclear/raddec.html#c1">Radioactive half-life</a><BR>1. If the half-life of a certain radioisotope is 1 year, what fractionof it will remain after 3 years?&nbsp; _____________<BR>2. For carbon-14 with a half-life of 5730 years, how long will it taketo decay to one-tenth of its original activity? _____________<BR>3. Iodine-131 has a half-life of 8 days. If a given contamination isconsidered tolerable when it has decayed to one-thousandth (0.001) of itsoriginal value, how long would that take? _____________<BR>4. Cesium-137, the most insidious of the contaminants released at Chernobyl,has a half-life of 30 years. If it must reduce to one-thousandth of itsinitial value, how long would that take? _____________<center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="../hph.html">HyperPhysics</a></td><td><a href="../chom.html">ClassHome</a></td><td><a href="p7120-3.html#c1">Physics 7120 Calendar</a></td></tr></table></center><BR>&nbsp;</BODY>
