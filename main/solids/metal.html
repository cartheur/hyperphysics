The chemical definition of a metal also includes having a characteristic surface luster or shine. It is characteristic of metals that they are malleable (can be hammered into sheets) and ductile (can be drawn into wires). A glance at the <a href="../pertab/pertab.html#c1">periodic table</a> will show you that the majority of pure elements are metals. All metals except mercury are solids at room temperature.</p><p> Both the high <a href="../electric/resis.html#c2">electrical conductivity</a> and <a href="../thermo/thercond.html#c1">thermal conductivity</a> come from the fact that one or more valence electrons is relatively free to travel throughout the solid material. This connection is formalized in the <a href="../thermo/thercond.html#c2">Wiedemann-Franz law</a>. </p><p>The microscopic properties of metals are often stated in terms of their <a href="fermi.html#c1">Fermi energy</a> and their free electron density.</p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../solcon.html"> Condensed Matter </A>*****<A HREF="../emcon.html#emcon"> Electricity and Magnetism </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
