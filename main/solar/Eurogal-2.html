<HEAD>   <TITLE>Jupiter Moon Europa Imaged by Galileo</TITLE></HEAD><body bgcolor="#FFE4C8"><!-- Copyright 2001 by Carl Rod Nave, RodNave@gsu.edu--><A Name="c1"></A><TABLE WIDTH="680" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="604" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center> Europa's Surface as Seen by Galileo</H1><table><tr><td><center><img src="picsol/eurfract-2.jpg"></center><center> <a href="nasa-3.html#c1">NASA</a> images from <a href="galileo-3.html#c1">Galileo orbiter</a></center></td><td>This view of Jupiter's moon Europa shows a portion of the surface that hasbeen highly disrupted by fractures and ridges. This picture covers an areaabout 238 kilometers (150 miles) wide by 225 kilometers (140 miles), orabout the distance between Los Angeles and San Diego. Symmetric ridges inthe dark bands suggest that the surface crust was separated and filled withdarker material, somewhat analogous to spreading centers in the ocean basinsof Earth. Although some impact craters are visible, their general absenceindicates a youthful surface. The youngest ridges, such as the two featuresthat cross the center of the picture, have central fractures, aligned knobs,and irregular dark patches. These and other features could indicatecryovolcanism, or processes related to eruption of ice and gases.This picture was taken at a distance of 40,973 kilometers (25,290 mi) onNovember 6, 1996 by the Galileo spacecraft solid state imaging televisioncamera onboard the Galileo spacecraft during its third orbit around Jupiter.</p></td></tr></table><table><tr><td><center><img src="picsol/euridge-2.jpg"></center></td><td><p>This moderate-resolution view  shows the complex icy crust that has been extensively modified byfracturing and the formation of ridges. The ridge systems superficiallyresemble highway networks with overpasses, interchanges and junctions. Fromthe relative position of the overlaps, it is possible to determine the agesequence for the ridge sets. For example, while the 8-kilometer-wide(5-mile) ridge set in the lower left corner is younger than most of theterrain seen in this picture, a narrow band cuts across the set toward thebottom of the picture, indicating that the band formed later. </td></tr></table><p>In turn, thisband is cut by the narrow 2- kilometer-wide (1.2-mile) double ridge runningfrom the lower right to upper left corner of the picture. Also visible arenumerous clusters of hills and low domes as large as 9 kilometers (5.5miles) across, many with associated dark patches of non-ice material. Theridges, hills and domes are considered to be ice-rich material derived fromthe subsurface. These are some of the youngest features seen on the surfaceof Europa and could represent geologically young eruptions.</p><p>This area covers about 140 kilometers by 130 kilometers (87 miles by 81miles) and is centered at 12.3 degrees north latitude, 268 degrees westlongitude. Illumination is from the east (right side of picture). Theresolution is about 180 meters (200 yards) per pixel, meaning that thesmallest feature visible is about a city block in size. The picture wastaken by the Solid State Imaging system on board the Galileo spacecraft onFebruary 20, 1997, from a distance of 17,700 kilometers (11,000 miles)during its sixth orbit around Jupiter.</p><A Name="c2"></A><table><tr><td><center><img src="picsol/eurcrat-2.jpg"></center></td><td><p><p> This is a more detailed view of Pwyll crater , which is shown in the southern hemisphere of  a <a href="europa-3.html#c1">full view of Europa</a>.  It was photographed by the Solid StateImaging system on the Galileo spacecraft  on February 20, 1997 during its sixth orbit aroundJupiter. It was at a distance of 12,000 km (7,500 mi) from Europa.  </td></tr></table><p>This impact crater is located at 26 degrees south latitude, 271degrees west longitude, and is about 26 kilometers (16 miles) in diameter.Lower resolution pictures of Pwyll Crater taken earlier in the mission showthat material ejected by the impact can be traced for hundreds of milesacross the icy surface of Europa. The dark zone seen here in and around thecrater is material excavated from several kilometers (a few miles) below thesurface. Also visible in this picture are complex ridges.</p><table><tr><td><center><img src="picsol/eurclos-2.jpg"></center></td><td><p>This close-up view of the icy surface of Europa, a moon of Jupiter, wasobtained on December 20, 1996, by the Solid State Imaging system on boardthe Galileo spacecraft during its fourth orbit around Jupiter. The view isabout 13 kilometers by 18 kilometers (8 miles by 11 miles) and has aresolution of 26 meters (28 yards). The Sun illuminates the scene from theeast (right).</td></tr></table>A flat smooth area about 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) across is seen in the leftpart of the picture. This area resulted from flooding by a fluid whicherupted onto the surface and buried sets of ridges and grooves. The smootharea contrasts with a distinctly rugged patch of terrain farther east, tothe right of the prominent ridge system running down the middle of thepicture. The rugged patch of terrain is 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) across andrepresents localized disruption of the complex network of ridges in thearea. Eruptions of material onto the surface, crustal disruption, and theformation of complex networks of folded and faulted ridges show thatsignificant energy was available in the interior of Europa. Although smallimpact craters are most easily seen in the smooth area, they occurthroughout the ridged terrain seen in this view.     <center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="europa-3.html#c1"> Europa Discussion</a></td></tr></table></center>   </TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="jupitercon-2.html#c1">Jupiter Concepts</a><br><br><a href="solill-2.html#c1">Solar System Illustration</a><br><br><a href="solarcon-2.html#c1">Solar System Concepts</a><br><br>References<br><a href="../astro/astref.html#c1">Chaisson & McMillan, </a><br>Ch 11.</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>**********<A HREF="../astro/astcon.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
