After intervening deep space probes which gave much information about the Sun, Pioneer 10 was launched outward toward Jupiter. After passing through the asteroid belt unharmed, Pioneer 10 passed Jupiter on December 3, 1973 and continued to send back data after it passed the orbit of Pluto in April 1983.</p>     <p> Pioneer 11 was launched in April of 1973 and reached Saturn on Sep 1, 1979. It came within 21,000 km of <a href="saturn.html#c1">Saturn</a> and only 2,000 to 10000 km below the visible rings. Pioneer Venus was launched on May 20, 1978 and was inserted into orbit around <a href="venus.html#c1">Venus</a> on Dec 4, 1978 (198 day trip). Pioneer Venus launched a "multiprobe" consisting of five separate instrument packages on Aug 8, 1978 and it reached Venus on Dec 9, 1978 (123 day trip).  At this point it made an hour-long descent to the Venus surface, returning information about the variation of density, temperture and chemical composition of the atmosphere with height. The orbiter stayed at an altitude of 150 km and mapped most of the planet's surface. </p><p>   </TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="solill.html#c1">Solar System Illustration</a><br><br><a href="solarcon.html#c1">Solar System Concepts</a><br><br><a href="solexplor.html#c1">Solar System Exploration</a><br><br>References<br><a href="../astro/astref.html#c1">Colin, L.</a><br>(Venus)<br><br><a href="../astro/astref.html#c1">Dyer, J.W. </a><br>(Saturn)</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>**********<A HREF="../astro/astcon.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c2"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center> Pioneer 3 and 4</H1><table><tr><td><p>Pioneer 4 was the first U.S. spacecraft to escape the Earth.
