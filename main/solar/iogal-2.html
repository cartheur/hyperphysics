The blue color of the plume is consistent withthe presence of sulfur dioxide gas and "snow" condensing fromthe gas as the plume expands and cools. Galileo images have alsoshown that the Ra Patera plume glows in the dark, perhaps due tothe fluorescence of sulfur and oxygen ions created by the breakingapart of sulfur dioxide molecules by energetic particles in theJovian magnetosphere. The images at right show a comparison ofchanges seen near the volcano Ra Patera since the Voyager spacecraftflybys of 1979</p><p>The imaged plume is believed  to be a geyser-like eruption driven by sulfur dioxide orsulfur gas erupting and freezing in Io's extremely tenuous atmosphere.Volcanic eruptions on Earth cannot throw materials to such highaltitudes. Ra Patera is the site of dramatic surface changes. An areaaround the volcano of about 40,000 square kilometers, area about thesize of New Jersey, has been covered by new volcanic deposits. Theimage was taken in late June 28, 1996 from a distance of 972,000kilometers (604,000 miles).</p><center><img src="picsol/iocloud-2.jpg"></center>NASA's Galileo spacecraft took the above high-resolution image of Io in front ofJupiter's cloudy atmosphere. Galileo wasabout 487,000 kilometers (about 302,000 miles) from Io when this was takenon September 7, 1996, and Jupiter was about 908,000 kilometers (about564,000 miles) away. The image is centered on the side of Io that alwaysfaces away from Jupiter. The color in the image is composed of data taken inthe near-infrared, green and violet filters of Galileo's solid-state imagingcamera, and has been enhanced to emphasize the extraordinary variations incolor and brightness that characterize Io's volcano-pocked face. The blackand bright red materials correspond to the most recent volcanic deposits,probably no more than a few years old. The near-infrared filter makesJupiter's atmosphere look blue. The active volcano Prometheus is seen nearthe right-center of the disk. </p><center><table><tr><td><center><img src="picsol/ioredring-2.jpg"></center></td><td>This image of Io is part of a series shot by the Galileo spacecraft.
