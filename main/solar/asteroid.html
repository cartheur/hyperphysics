Their orbits are typically more eccentric than those of the planets. The largest asteroid, Ceres, is 940 kilometers in diameter and has about 1/10000 the mass of the Earth.  With over 7000 asteroids catalogued, the total number may exceed 100,000. However, their combined mass is less than 1/10 that of the Earth's Moon. </p><table><tr><td><center><img src="imgsol/asteroidloc.gif"></center></td><td>    <p>All solid bodies in our Solar Systen show craters where they have collided with asteroids and comets. </p>    <p> A few asteroids cross the Earth's orbit. The most notable of these are Apollo, Icarus, Adonis, and Eros. Hector has an orbit similar to that of Jupiter, and Hidalgo has a large elliptical orbit which extends from about the orbit of Mars out well beyond the orbit of Jupiter.  </p>    <p>Asteroid <a href="gaspra.html#c1">Gaspra</a> was used in slingshot maneuver with <a href="galileo.html#c1">Galileo</a> in 1991 on the way toward ultimate rendevouz with Jupiter. Galileo also provided a close view of asteroid <a href="ida.html#c1">Ida</a>. </p>     </td></tr></table> <p>The vast majority of the <a href="meteor.html#c1">meteorites</a> that hit the Earth are thought to come from the asteroid belt.</p>  <p>Asteroids are classified from their observed reflectivity, with C-type asteroids making up about 75% of them. C-type or carbonaceous asteroids are dark from the high content of carbon in them. S-type asteroids contain silicate and are more reflective - they make up about 15% of the asteroids. Most of the remaining asteroids are called M-type and contain large fractions of iron and nickel. The C-type asteroids are supposed to be very primitive material that has not been significantly heated or changed chemically since they were <a href="../nuclear/clkroc.html#c6">formed</a> some 4.6 billion years ago. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="solill.html#c1">Solar System Illustration</a><br><br><a href="solarcon.html#c1">Solar System Concepts</a><BR><BR>Reference<br><a href="../astro/astref.html">Chaisson and McMillan</a><br>Ch 14</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>**********<A HREF="../astro/astcon.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
