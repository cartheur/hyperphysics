Simulated color is used to enhance small-scale structure. The simulated hues are based on color imagesrecorded by the <a href="venera.html#c1">Venera</a> 13/14 landing craft. The twisting bright features that cross the globe from the lower left toward the upper right are the highlyfractured mountains and canyons of the eastern highland of <a href="venusland.html#c1">Aphrodite Terra</a>. Just to the right of center is the Atla region, dominated by three large volcanoes:Sapas, Maat and Ozza Montes. The image was produced by the Solar System visualization project and the Magellan Science team at the JPLMultimission Image Processing Laboratory.</P><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="sapasmons.html#c1">Higher resolution view of Sapas Mons</a></td></tr></table></center></td></tr></table><table><tr><td><img src="picsol/venuvol.jpg"><br><center><a href="nasa.html#c1">NASA</a> image from <a href="magellan.html#c1">Magellan spacecraft</a>.</center><br></td><td><p>The volcanoes of Venus take unusual shapes, but they are all classified as "shield volcanoes" like those which occur in Hawaii. Using the high resolution of the side-looking radar, thicknesses for some of the features could be obtained from the Magellan data.  Parallax measurements show that the thickness of the lobe of lava at the left-center edges of the image is variable but typicallyabout 540 meters (1772 feet). The fan-shaped lava flow in the lower left isabout 120 meters (394 feet) thick near its edge. Lava scarps on the east side of the complex are about 90 meters (295 feet) high.</P></td></tr></table><center><img src="picsol/venus3dvol.jpg"></center>A better perspective of the volcanoes with respect to their surroundings can be seen in this 3-d construction of a portion of Western Eistla Regio. Lava flows extend for hundreds of kilometers across the fractured plainsshown in the foreground, to the base of Gula Mons. We are looking to the southwest with Gula Mons appearing at the left just below the horizon. GulaMons, a 3 kilometer (1.86 mile) high volcano and Sif Mons, a volcano with adiameter of 300 kilometers (180 miles) and a height of 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) are shown. The distance between Sif Mons and GulaMons is approximately 730 kilometers (453 miles). Magellan synthetic aperture radar data is combined with radar altimetry to develop a three-dimensionalmap of the surface. Simulated color anda digital elevation map developed by Randy Kirk of the U.S. Geological Survey, are used to enhance small scale structure. The simulated hues are based oncolor images recorded by the Soviet Venera 13 and 14 spacecraft. The image was produced at the JPL Multimission Image Processing Laboratory by Eric DeJong, Jeff Hall, and Myche McAuley, and was released at a March 5, 1991, JPL news conference. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="venuscon.html#c1">Venus Concepts</a><br><br><a href="solarcon.html#c1">Solar System Concepts</a><br><br><a href="solexplor.html#c1">Solar System Exploration</a><br><br>References<br><a href="../astro/astref.html#c1">Chaisson & McMillan, </a><br>Ch 9.</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>**********<A HREF="../astro/astcon.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c2"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center> Impact Features on Venus</H1><center><img src="picsol/ven3d3crat.jpg"></center><center><a href="nasa.html#c1">NASA</a> image from <a href="magellan.html#c1">Magellan spacecraft</a>.</center><br><p>A perspective of impact features on <a href="venus.html#c1">Venus</a> is obtained from the Magellan synthetic aperture radar data  combined with radar altimetry.

The crater is complex, characterized by a partial central ring and a floor flooded by radar-dark and radar-bright materials.Hummocky, rough-textured ejecta extend all around the crater, except to the west. The lack of ejecta to the west may indicate that theimpactor that produced the crater was an oblique impact from the west. Extensive radar-bright flows that emanate from the crater's easternwalls may represent large volumes of impact melt, or they may be the result of volcanic material released from the subsurface during thecratering event.</td></tr></table></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="venuscon.html#c1">Venus Concepts</a><br><br><a href="solarcon.html#c1">Solar System Concepts</a><br><br><a href="solexplor.html#c1">Solar System Exploration</a><br><br>References<br><a href="../astro/astref.html#c1">Chaisson & McMillan, </a><br>Ch 9.</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>**********<A HREF="../astro/astcon.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
