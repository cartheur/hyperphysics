First reported by British scientist Robert Hooke in the mid-seventeenth century, the great red spot has been observed for over 300 years. It is a pattern of swirling winds, like a hurricane twice the diameter of the Earth.  Presently it is an oval some 25,000 by 15,000 kilometers, compared to the Earth's diameter of 12,756 km. Within the pattern of colored bands which move in alternating directions, the red spot moves around the planet with  a period similar to the interior of the planet. This suggests that its roots reach down into the interior of the planet. </p><p>The flow around the red spot is counterclockwise, with a period of about 6 days. Wind speeds associated with the flow reach about 200 km/h. While the center of the red spot appears rather calm, the edges are turbulent, spinning off smaller eddies. The spot appears to be driven by the zonal flow which is westward at the top of the spot and eastward at the bottom, but many mysteries remain. </p><p>Besides the great red spot, there are numerous other ovals, some red and some white, which represent smaller storms on the planet. There are also features called "brown ovals" which appear to be holes in the atmoshpere which allow us to see deeper into the planet. </p><p>Accustomed as we are to the pattern of hurricanes on the Earth, which are thankfully short-lived, it is surprising to see the long-term persistence of these storm features on Jupiter. One comment by Chaisson and McMillan is that hurricanes tend to break up as they reach land masses, and there are no such obstructions on Jupiter. Another factor is the rapid rotation of Jupiter (just under 10 hours for this huge planet's period), which wraps the high and low pressure systems all the way around the planet, making conditions more stable.  </TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index<br><br><a href="jupitercon-2.html#c1">Jupiter Concepts</a><br><br><a href="solarcon-2.html#c1">Solar System Concepts</a><br><br>References<br><a href="../astro/astref.html#c1">Chaisson & McMillan, </a><br>Ch 11.</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>**********<A HREF="../astro/astcon.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c2"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center> The Atmospheric Bands of Jupiter</H1><p>The surface of <a href="jupiter-2.html#c1">Jupiter</a> is divided into rotating bands which alternate between bright zones and darker, reddish belts. These bands change with time, even though there are no seasons on Jupiter, so they appear to be dynamic changes in the atmosphere. Relative to the rotation rate of the interior of the planet, these bands can reach velocities over 300 km/h. The bright zones are modeled as upward-moving convective currents in the atmosphere. The darker belts represent cooler downflow zones, the other part of the convective cycle. The bright zones lie slightly higher in the atmosphere than the belts. </p> </TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="jupitercon-2.html#c1">Jupiter Concepts</a><br><br><a href="solarcon-2.html#c1">Solar System Concepts</a><br><br>References<br><a href="../astro/astref.html#c1">Chaisson & McMillan, </a><br>Ch 11.</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>**********<A HREF="../astro/astcon.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c3"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center> Jupiter: One of the Gas Giants</H1><p><a href="jupiter-2.html#c1">Jupiter</a>, along with <a href="saturn-2.html#c1">Saturn and <a href="uranus-2.html#c1">Uranus</a> are sometimes called the "gas giants".
