It involved four launches, the first unmanned to deploy the first unit. Skylab 1 itself was launched on May 14, 1973 and first manned during the period May 25 toJune 22, 1973. It had to deal with the failure of the heat shield to deploy on Skylab 1; that repair was made and the mission was successful. Skylab 3 was launched on 28 July, 1973 and landed in the Pacific on September 25. The third and final manned period was an 84 day mission from November 16, 1973, to February 8, 1974. </p><center><img src="picsol/skylab-2.jpg"></center>   </TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="solarcon-2.html#c1">Solar System Concepts</a><br><br><a href="solexplor-2.html#c1">Solar System Exploration</a><br><br><a href="satelitcon-2.html#c1">Earth Satellites</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>**********<A HREF="../astro/astcon.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c2"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center> MIR</H1><table><tr><td><img src="picsol/mir-2.jpg"></td><td><p>For 14 years the ambitious Soviet MIR space station stayed aloft, reaching a number of milestones in the habitation of space and providing a large amount of experience in the continuous operation of a space station.
