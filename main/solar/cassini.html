<p> Cassini is an international space exploration mission. The <a href="huygens.html#c1">Huygens probe</a>, built by the European Space Agency, was launched to <a href="titan.html#c1">Titan</a>,  one of the moons of Saturn. Some of the experimental equipment was provided by ASI, the Italian space agency.</p> <p>The plan is for Cassini to travel more than 2.2 billion miles over a decade, carrying 18 experimental instruments. 

<p>From NASA/JPL's <a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/introduction/">Cassini site</a> intro: 
"Cassini completed its initial four-year mission to explore the Saturn System in June 2008 and the first extended mission, called the Cassini Equinox Mission, in September 2010. Now, the healthy spacecraft is seeking to make exciting new discoveries in a second extended mission called the Cassini Solstice Mission.
The mission's extension, which goes through September 2017, is named for the Saturnian summer solstice occurring in May 2017. The northern summer solstice marks the beginning of summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere. Since Cassini arrived at Saturn just after the planet's northern winter solstice, the extension will allow for the first study of a complete seasonal period.
Cassini launched in October 1997 with the European Space Agency's Huygens probe. The probe was equipped with six instruments to study Titan, Saturn's largest moon. It landed on Titan's surface on Jan. 14, 2005, and returned spectacular results.
Meanwhile, Cassini's 12 instruments have returned a daily stream of data from Saturn's system since arriving at Saturn in 2004."
