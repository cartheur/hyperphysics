The comet had been tracked for 14 months and almost every earth-based telescope plus the <a href="hst.html#c1">Hubble</a> were trained on Jupiter for the impacts. In the plumes thrown up by the impacts, spectra revealed ammonia (which had been seen before) along with sulfur and hydrogen sulfide (which had not been seen before). The data are consistent with high altitude explosions which did not penetrate much below the visible cloud tops.  </p> <table><tr><td><img src="picsol/irsl92.jpg"></td> <td><img src="picsol/shoelevyart.jpg"></td><td>Images of Jupiter after the impact of the R-fragment.
