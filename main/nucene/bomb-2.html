A thermonuclear explosion can be created only by producing the required temperature, about a hundred-million Kelvins, and by forcing the material together so quickly that it will fuse rapidly. This is typically done with the isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium. This led to the term "hydrogen bomb" to describe the <a href="fusion-2.html#c2">deuterium-tritium</a> fusion bomb. </p>     <p>To obtain the two parts of the fuel, pellets were made from lithium hydride, LiD, made with the deuterium isotope. The only way which was found to produce the ignition temperature was to set off a fission bomb such that it would heat and compress the lithium hydride. In the process, the lithium was bombarded with neutrons, <a href="fusion-2.html#c5">breeding</a> tritium. Then the deuterium-tritium fusion reaction could take place.   </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="nwepcn-2.html#c1">Nuclear weapon concepts</a><br><br><a href="nengcn-2.html#c1">Nuclear energy concepts</a><br><br><a href="fiscon-2.html#c1">Fission concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../nuccon.html#nuccon">     Nuclear </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c2"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Hydrogen Bomb</H1><p> Because the <a href="#c1">thermonuclear</a> explosive devices used hydrogen <a href="../nuclear/nucnot.html#c2">isotopes</a>, (<a href="fusion-2.html#c2">deuterium-tritium fusion</a>), the resulting bombs were often called "hydrogen bombs".  The first hydrogen bomb was detonated on November 1, 1952 at the small island Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands. It's yield was several megatons of TNT. The Soviet Union detonated a fusion bomb in the megaton range in August of 1953. The U.S. exploded a 15 megaton fusion bomb on March 1, 1954. It had a fireball 4.8 km in diameter and created a huge characteristic mushroom-shaped cloud. Analysis of the radioactive fallout from this bomb revealed it to be a fission-fusion-fission weapon, a "hydrogen bomb" with an outer sheath of natural uranium to increase the yield.</p> </TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="nwepcn-2.html#c1">Nuclear weapon concepts</a><br><br><a href="nengcn-2.html#c1">Nuclear energy concepts</a><br><br><a href="fiscon-2.html#c1">Fission concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../nuccon.html#nuccon">     Nuclear </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c3"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Uranium Bomb</H1><p>Using the energy release from the <a href="fission-2.html#c1">nuclear fission</a> of <a href="fission-2.html#c2">uranium-235</a>, an explosive device can be made by simply positioning two masses of U-235 so that they can be forced together quickly enough to form a <a href="moder-2.html#c4">critical mass</a> and a rapid, uncontrolled fission <a href="u235chn-3.html#c4">chain reaction</a>. That is not to say that this is an easy task to accomplish. First you must obtain enough uranium which is highly <a href="ligwat-2.html#c2">enriched</a> to over 90% U-235, whereas natural uranium is only 0.7% U-235. This enrichment is an exceptionally difficult task, a fact that has helped control the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Once the required mass is obtained, it must be kept in two or more pieces until the moment of detonation. Then the pieces must be forced together quickly and in such a geometry that the <a href="control-2.html#c2">generation time</a> for fission is extremely short. This leads to an almost instantaneous buildup of the chain reaction, creating a powerful explosion before the pieces can fly apart. Two hemispheres which are explosively forced into contact can produce a bomb such as the one detonated at <a href="#c5">Hiroshima</a>. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="nwepcn-2.html#c1">Nuclear weapon concepts</a><br><br><a href="nengcn-2.html#c1">Nuclear energy concepts</a><br><br><a href="fiscon-2.html#c1">Fission concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../nuccon.html#nuccon">     Nuclear </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c4"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Plutonium Bomb</H1><p>Plutonium-239 is a <a href="fission-2.html#c4">fissionable isotope</a> and can be used to make a nuclear fission bomb similar to that produced with <a href="#c5">uranium-235</a>. The bomb which was dropped at <a href="#c6">Nagasaki</a> was a plutonium bomb. Not enough Pu-239 exists in nature to make a major weapons supply, but it is easily produced in <a href="fasbre-2.html#c1">breeder reactors</a>. In the U.S., there are reactors at Savannah River Plant, S.C., and at Hanford, Washington which are classified as plutonium production reactors. They breed plutonium by surrounding a fission reactor with a uranium-238 "blanket" to make use of the <a href="fasbre-2.html#c2">breeding reaction</a> between neutrons and U-238. Once the plutonium is produced, it is easily separated from the other fission products by chemical means, so that less technology is needed to produce a nuclear weapon if you have a breeder reactor. This makes plutonium a greater source of concern for weapons proliferation, because reactors which appear to be just electric power generators can be breeding plutonium for weapons along with the power production. </p> <p>The type of bomb which was dropped on <a href="#c6">Nagasaki</a> on August 9, 1945 had been tested at Alamagordo, New Mexico on July 16.

The bomb, called "Little Boy" was a "<a href="bomb3-2.html#c4">gun-type</a>" device which used an explosive charge to force two sub-critical masses of U-235 together. It was 28 inches in diameter and 120 inches long, a relatively small package to deliver an explosive force of some 20,000 <a href="bomb2-2.html#c3">tons of TNT</a> by converting about 1 gram of matter into energy.
