Cadmium and boron are strong neutron absorbers and are the most common materials used in control rods. A typical neutron absorption reaction in boron is</p><center><img src="imgnuk/crod1-2.gif"></center><p>In the operation of a nuclear reactor, fuel assemblies are put into place and then the control rods are slowly lifted until a chain reaction can just be sustained. As the reaction proceeds, the number of uranium-235 nuclei decreases and fission by-products which absorb neutrons build up. To keep the chain reaction going, the control rods must be withdrawn further. At some point, the chain reaction cannot be maintained and the fuel must be replenished. <p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="fiscon-2.html#c1">Fission concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../nuccon.html#nuccon">     Nuclear </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c2"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Generation Time for Fission</H1><p>The average time for a neutron emitted in one fission to cause another fission is called the generation time.

For <a href="u235chn-3.html#c2">U-235 fission</a> the average number of neutrons emitted is 2.4, so the maximum reproduction constant would be 2.4. While the highly <a href="ligwat-2.html#c2">enriched</a> uranium-235 for weapons applications arranged in an optimum geometry might approach that, the reproduction constant is greatly diminished in nuclear reactors by the fact that the fuel is only about 2-3% U-235. For power reactors the reproduction constant is kept just above 1. A reactor configuration with a reproduction constant of 1 is said to be <a href="moder-2.html#c4">critical</a>. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="fiscon-2.html#c1">Fission concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../nuccon.html#nuccon">     Nuclear </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c4"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Delayed Neutron Effect  </H1><p> The doubling time of a <a href="fission-2.html#c1">nuclear fission</a> reaction is a reasonable measure of the response time within which reactor safety devices would have to react to some kind of emergency. This doubling time is determined by the <a href="#c3">reproduction constant</a> of the reactor configuration and the <a href="#c2">generation time</a> of the fission process. One margin of safety in the kinds of nuclear <a href="reactor-2.html#c3">power reactors</a> used in the U.S. and Canada comes from the fact that in their operating range they are only <a href="moder-2.html#c4">critical</a> with the inclusion of the <a href="moder-2.html#c5">delayed neutrons</a>. The effect this has on the doubling time can be seen in the following example. For k = 1.001 , it takes 693 generations to double the rate, and at generation time of 0.001 s, the <a href="#c2">doubling time</a> is 0.693 seconds. If .65% of the neutrons are delayed by an average of 14 seconds, the doubling time is increased by almost a factor of a hundred to</p>              <center>693 ((.9935)(.001s) + (.0065)(14s)) = 63.8 seconds</center><p>which is sufficient time for mechanical controls to respond. For example, the Three Mile Island <a href="tmi-2.html#c6">safety devices</a> had shut down the reactor within 9 seconds of the event which triggered the accident.  </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="fiscon-2.html#c1">Fission concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../nuccon.html#nuccon">     Nuclear </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
