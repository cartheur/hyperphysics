It is that threshold of motion which is characterized by the <a href="frict.html#coe">coefficient</a> of static friction. The coefficient of static friction is typically larger than the coefficient of <a href="#kin">kinetic friction</a>.</p><center><img src="imgmec/fsta.gif"></center><p>In making a distinction between static and kinetic coefficients of friction, we are dealing with an aspect of "real world" common experience with a phenomenon which cannot be simply characterized. The difference between static and kinetic coefficients obtained in simple experiments like wooden blocks sliding on wooden inclines roughly follows the model depicted in the <a href="#plo">friction plot</a> from which the illustration above is taken. This difference may arise from irregularities, surface contaminants, etc. which defy precise description. When such experiments are carried out with smooth metal blocks which are carefully cleaned, the difference between static and kinetic coefficients tends to disappear. When coefficients of friction are quoted for specific surface combinations are quoted, it is the kinetic coefficient which is generally quoted since it is the more reliable number.</p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="fricon.html">Friction concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="hph.html#mechcon">     Mechanics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="kin"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Kinetic Friction</H1>  When two surfaces are moving with respect to one another, the frictional resistance is almost constant over a wide range of low speeds, and in the <a href="frict.html#fri">standard model</a> of friction the frictional force is described by the relationship below.

To quote a view counter to the above model of friction:<br>"Many people believe that the friction to be overcome to get something started (static friction) exceeds the force required to keep it sliding (sliding friction), but with dry metals it is very hard to show any difference. The opinion probably arises from experiences where small bits of oil or lubricant are present, or where blocks, for example, are supported by springs or other flexible supports so that they appear to bind."

The amount of traction which can be obtained for an auto tire is determined by the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road. If the wheel is locked and sliding, the force of friction is determined by the coefficient of kinetic friction and is usually significantly less.</p>     <p>Assuming that a  wheel is rolling without slipping, the surface friction does no work against the motion of the wheel and no energy is lost at that point. However, there is some loss of energy and some deceleration from friction for any real wheel, and this is sometimes referred to as rolling friction. It is partly friction at the axle and can be partly due to flexing of the wheel which will dissipate some energy. Figures of 0.02 to 0.06 have been reported as effective coefficients of rolling friction for automobile tires, compared to about 0.8 for the maximum static friction coefficient between the tire and the road.  </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="fricon.html">Friction concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="hph.html#mechcon">     Mechanics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
