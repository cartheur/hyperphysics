While this is approximately true for a wide range of low speeds, as the speed increases and air friction is encountered, it is found that the friction not only depends on the speed, but upon the square and sometimes higher powers of the speed. If there are fluid lubricants involved, then viscous resistance is encountered, and it is speed dependent. </p>    <p> Like the other standard assumptions, exceptions are easy to find, but the assumption is nevertheless useful for modeling a wide variety of circumstances where two solid materials move relative to each other.  </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="fricon.html">Friction concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="hph.html#mechcon">     Mechanics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="nor"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Friction and Normal Force</H1> <p> Part of the <a href="frict.html#fri">standard model</a> of surface friction is the <a href="#ass">assumption</a> that the frictional resistance force between two surfaces is proportional to the <a href="frict.html#nor">normal force</a> pressing them together. A common exception occurs in snow where greater traction occurs by having wider tires with lower pressure. The samenormal force is exerted, but the traction (friction) is greater with the wider                                                                 tire since it doesn't pack the snow                                                                   as much. The packing of the snow tends to depend on the <a href="press.html#pre">pressure</a> exerted on the snow, and supporting the same weight on a smaller area implies that more pressure is exerted.

Jones and Childers have a thoughtful discussion of this. They point out that the area of coverage for a sliding block is actually much larger than the area of contact. Because of microscopic irregularities in the surface, the block is actually riding on a small fraction of the coverage area. Because such points of contact are deformable, an increase in normal force will actually increase the area of actual contact and increase the resistance to movement.  </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="fricon.html">Friction concepts</a><BR><BR>Reference<br><a href="mecref.html#c1">Jones & Childers, 2nd Ed.</a><br>Sec 4.8</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="hph.html#mechcon">     Mechanics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
