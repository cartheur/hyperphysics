A disturbance like an earthquake at any point on the Earth will produce energetic waves called seismic waves. </p><p>The Earth's crust as a solid object will support waves through the crust called body waves and on the surface (surface waves). In a solid material these waves can be either <a href="../sound/tralon.html#c1">longitudinal waves</a> or <a href="../sound/tralon.html#c1">transverse waves</a>. For seismic waves through the bulk material the longitudinal or compressional waves are called <b>P waves</b>  (for "primary" waves) whereas the transverse waves are callled <b>S waves</b> ("secondary" waves). Since any material, solid or liquid (fluid) is subject to compression, the P waves can travel through any kind of material. However, S waves depend upon a resistance to transverse or "shear" force which does not exist in a liquid or gas medium, so they can only travel in the solid parts of the Earth (see <a href="../sound/mamlak.html#c1">geologic example</a>). </p><center><img src="imgwav/pwave.gif"></center><center><img src="imgwav/swave.gif"></center><p> P waves in air are simply sound waves and the <a href="../sound/souspe.html#c1">speed of sound</a> is around 340 m/s for ordinary temperatures. Water can support P waves but not S waves, and the speed of these P waves (speed of sound) in water is about 1450 m/s. P waves depend upon the <a href="../permot3.html#c1">bulk modulus of elasticity</a> for the material as well as its density, and the <a href="../sound/souspe2.html#c1">wave speed</a> in a solid material like <a href="../geophys/granite.html#c1">granite</a> can be about 5000 m/s. The P waves from an earthquake arrive first, but because of their small amplitudes don't do as much damage as the S waves and surface waves which follow.</p><p>S waves are transverse waves which involve movement of the ground perpendicular to the velocity of propagation. They travel only through solids, and the absence of detected S waves at large distances from earthquakes was the first indication that the Earth has a liquid core. S waves travel typically 60% of the speed of P waves. They are typically more damaging than the P waves because they are several times higher in amplitude. </p><p>Earthquakes also produce surface waves which may cause motion perpendicular to the surface or parallel to the surface. The waves which move the surface up and down are called <b>Rayleigh waves</b> and are sometimes described as "ground roll". Waves whose amplitude of moton is parallel to the surface are called <b>Love waves</b> (named after the mathematician A. E. H. Love who modeled them - definitely not an indication that anyone is fond of them). <p>Rayleigh waves or ground roll waves cause the surface of the ground to move up and down. They travel at roughly 90% of the speed of the S waves. Love waves involve the motion of the ground side-to-side, perpendicular to the propagation velocity. They usually travel slightly faster than the Rayleigh waves. </p><p>References:<br>Wiki:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_wave">Seismic waves</a></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="../sound/trawvcon.html#c1">Wave concepts</a><BR><BR>Reference:<br><a href="../geophys/gphysref.html">Marshak</a><br>Ch. 8<br><br><a href="../geophys/gphysref.html">Lutgens & Tarbuck</a><br>Ch. 15</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../sound/soucon.html">     Sound </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
