Why is that? For one thing, the applied pressure does not create much tension in the walls of a small balloon to start the stretching process necessary for inflation. According to <a href="ptens.html#bal">LaPlace's law</a>, the wall tension will be twice as large for a balloon of twice the radius. If it takes a certain applied pressure to overcome the elasticity of the large balloon and cause it to expand further, it will take twice as much pressure to start to expand the smaller balloon. All this makes it difficult for the baby to take its first breath -- all the balloons are small!  The <a href= "ptens2.html#alv" >alveoli</a> of the lungs are collapsed in the fetus and must be inflated in the process of inhalation. Thus the traditional spank on the bottom of the newborn to make him/her mad enough to make the effort for the first breath. Further difficulties are encountered by premature infants because the <a href= "ptens2.html#sur" >surfactant fluid</a> which coats the alveoli to give them the appropriate wall tensions is formed in the later stages of pregnacy. Until that point, the alveoli are coated with fluid which has essentially the <a href="surten.html#c1">surface tension</a> of water, much higher than that of the normal surfactant. </TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="lapcon.html">LaPlace's law concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="hph.html#mechcon">     Mechanics </A>*****<A HREF="fluid.html#flucon">     Fluids </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="emp"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Emphysema</H1>  <p>The disease of the lungs called emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) results in the enlargement of the <a href= "ptens2.html#alv" >alveoli</a> of the lungs as some are destroyed and others either enlarge or combine. The disease is one of the destructive effects of long-term smoking, but sometimes occurs in non-smokers. If the normal inhalation process inflates the alveoli to a larger radius, the implications of <a href="ptens.html#bal">LaPlace's law</a> are that the wall must have lost much of its elasticity. Normally it would take twice the pressure to inflate a constant tension membrane to twice its radius. Typically, the wall tension of the healthy alveoli is determined by the surface tension of the liquid which coats them, and with a uniform coating (called a <a href= "ptens2.html#sur" >surfactant</a>), they will all inflate to a similar radius. The enlarged alveoli in the emphysema patient imply  less elastic recoil during the process of <a href="ptens2.html#alvx">exhalation</a>. Exhalation requires effort from the diaphragm and in advanced stages of the disease, a patient will not be able to blow out a match.</p><center><img src="imgmec/alveoli.gif"></center><p>Besides the loss of elasticity of the alveolar walls, the larger size of the compartments implies a smaller surface area for a given volume. Because the oxygen exchange from the air to the blood is proportional to the area of the exchange membrane, this diminishes the rate of oxygen transfer.</p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="lapcon.html">LaPlace's law concepts</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="mecref.html">Canadian Lung Association</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="hph.html#mechcon">     Mechanics </A>*****<A HREF="fluid.html#flucon">     Fluids </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="tens"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Tension in Arterial Walls</H1>  <p>The tension in the walls of arteries and veins in the human body is a classic example of <a href="ptens.html#bal">LaPlace's law</a>.

The large radii of the large arteries imply that for pressures in that range they must have strong walls to withstand the large resulting wall tension.  The larger arteries provide much less resistance to flow than the smaller vessels according to Poiseuille's law, and thus the drop in pressure across them is only about half the total drop. The capillaries offer large resistances to flow, but don't require much strength in their walls. </p><center><img src="imgmec/lapl3.gif"></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="lapcon.html">LaPlace's law concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="hph.html#mechcon">     Mechanics </A>*****<A HREF="fluid.html#flucon">     Fluids </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="aneu"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Danger of Aneurysms</H1>   <p>The larger arteries of the body are subject to higher wall tensions than the smaller arteries and capillaries. This wall tension follows the dictates of <a href="ptens.html#bal">LaPlace's law</a>, a geometrical relationship which shows that the wall tension is proportional to the radius for a given blood pressure. If an artery wall develops a weak spot and expands as a result, it might seem that the expansion would provide some relief, but in fact the opposite is true. In a classic "vicious cycle", the expansion subjects the weakened wall to even more tension. The weakened vessel may continue to expand in what is called an aneurysm. Unchecked, this condition will lead to rupture of the vessel, so aneurysms require prompt medical attention.</p>      <p>A localized weak spot in an artery might gain some temporary tension relief by expanding toward a spherical shape, since a spherical membrane has half the wall tension for a given radius. Minimizing membrane tension is why <a href="surten2.html#c1">soap bubbles</a> tend to form a spherical shape. But for an expanding artery, forming a near-spherical shape cannot be depended upon to give sufficient tension relief. </p><center><img src="imgmec/aneu2.gif"></center>  <center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><h3><a href="ptens.html#bal">Demonstration with balloon</a></h3></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="lapcon.html">LaPlace's law concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="hph.html#mechcon">     Mechanics </A>*****<A HREF="fluid.html#flucon">     Fluids </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
