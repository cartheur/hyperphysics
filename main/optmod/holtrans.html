The above images had a pathlength difference of approximately 15 cm. </li><li>There should be the same number of phase reversals in each beam, since the laser light has time-random elliptical polarization. This means the same number of mirrors in each beam - we had one mirror in reference beam. In the object beam, one part of it came from the sapphire lens and one part from the concave aluminum-foil mirror.</li></ul><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="holtrans2.html#c1">Revision of holography setup</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66"><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="holcon.html#c1">Holography concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../chom.html">     Class Home </A>*****<A HREF="../class/p391.html#p391">     Physics 3901 </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
