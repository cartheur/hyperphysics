It is located about 8.3 light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major. It's coordinates are (11:03:20.19+35:58:11.55, ICRS 2000.0) . It is named for its <a href="#c2">discoverer</a>. </p><p>This star generated considerable excitement in 1996 when the discovery of associated planets was announced. "This cool and dim, main sequence red dwarf (M2.1 Vne) has about 46 percent of Sol's mass (RECONS estimate), 46 percent of its diameter (Johnson and Wright, 1983, page 671), but less than 6/1,000th of its brightness. The star is less enriched in elements heavier than hydrogen ("metals") compared to our Sun, with around 63 percent of Sol's abundance of iron (Cayrel de Strobel et al, 1991, page 292). It is suspected to have at least one, but perhaps as many as three,  Jupiter-class planets."(Arnold O. Benz,  Institute of Astronomy,  ETH Zurich)</p><p>Gatewood, G. D. "Lalande 21185," Bulletin of the Aerican Astronomical Society, 28, 885 (1996). </p>"Lalande 21185 is about three times too faint to be seen with the naked eye. Although Lalande 21185 is almost 200 times dimmer than the Sun, it is among the brightest red dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. Moving perpendicular to the galactic plane at a high velocity of 47 km/s, Lalande 21185 appears to belong to the Galaxy's thick disk population and to be considerably older than the Sun. It has both a high radial velocity, of 86 km/s toward the Sun, and a high tangential velocity (proper motion) of 57 km/s. The former is bringing the star 0.028 light-year closer to us each century and to a closest approach of about 4.6 light-years in 22,000 AD."(http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/L/Lalande21185.html) </TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="strclos-2.html#c0">Nearby Stars</a><br><br><a href="starcon-2.html#c1">Star Concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../astro/astcon.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c2"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Discovery of Lalande 21185</H1> <p>The star Lalande 21185 " was first listed by  Joseph-Jérôme Lefrançais de Lalande (1732-1807), who became director of the Paris Observatory in 1795, produced the most comprehensive catalog for his time of 47,390 star positions (the Histoire Céleste Française) in 1801, and was actually the first person to add Flamsteed numbers to designate the brighter stars within each constellation in a French edition of John Flamsteed's (1645-1719) star catalog."

It is located only about 2.4 pc (7.8 light-years) away in the east central part (10:56:29+07:00.7, ICRS 2000.0) of Constellation  Leo, the Lion -- south of Chertan or Coxa (Theta Leonis). However, the star is much too dim to be visible to the naked eye. It was discovered photographically by  Max (Maximilian Franz Joseph Cornelius) Wolf (1863-1932), a pioneer of astrophotography who discovered hundreds of variable stars and asteroids, and about 5,000 nebulae by analyzing photographic plates and developing the "dry plate" in 1880 and the "blink comparator" in 1900 with the Carl Zeiss optics company in Jena, Germany.

If our Sun, Sol, were replaced by Wolf 359, then an observer on Earth would need a telescope to see its round shape clearly, and daylight would be very dim with only ten times the brightness of full moonlight with Sol. On the other hand, Wolf 359 is a Flare Star (that has been designated with the variable star name CN Leonis) and so can brighten dramatically from time to time. Flares on Wolf 359, however, are rarer and not as violent as those observed on  Proxima Centauri, Kruger 60 B, or  UV Ceti."(solstation)</p>Sources:<ul><li>http://www.solstation.com/stars/wolf359.htm<li>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_359</ul></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="strclos-2.html#c0">Nearby Stars</a><br><br><a href="starcon-2.html#c1">Star Concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../astro/astcon.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
