They are particularly found in the spiral arms. With the model of <a href="../astro/nucsyn.html#c1">heavy element formation</a> in <a href="../astro/snovcn.html#c2">supernovae</a>, this suggests that the gas from which they formed had been seeded with the heavy elements formed from previous giant stars. About 2% of the total belong to Population I. </p><p>Population II stars tend to be found in globular clusters and the nucleus of a galaxy. They tend to be older, less luminous and cooler than Population I stars. They have fewer heavy elements, either by being older or being in regions where no heavy-element producing predecessors would be found. Astronomers often describe this condition by saying that they are "metal poor", and the "<a href="../astro/nucsyn.html#c2">metallicity</a>" is used as an indication of age. </p></p></TD></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="starcon.html#c1">Star concepts</a><BR><BR></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../astro/astcon.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
