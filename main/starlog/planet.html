Ward and Brownlee in their book Rare Earth make the point that the formation of a planet like Earth that can support advanced life may be exceedingly rare. The search for and characterization of extrasolar planets is currently a very active area of research.</p><p>At present, it appears that the closest star with a planet is <a href="grm34.html#c4">Epsilon Eridani</a>, a relatively yound orange-red dwarf star only 10.5 light years from the Earth. The planet is about 1.5 times as massive as Jupiter and is in a highly elliptical orbit swinging from 2.4 to 5.8 <a href="../astro/para.html#c2">Astronomical Units</a> from the star compared to Jupiter's nearly circular orbit at 5.2 AU.</p><p>Another close neighbor, <a href="strclos.html#c4">Barnard's Star</a>, has also been shown to have planets. A protoplanetary disc around <a href="vega.html#c1">Vega</a> has been studied. According to Ward and Brownlee, the count of extrasolar planets was 198 in 2000, with the count now having exceeded 200. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="starcon.html#c1">Star Concepts</a><br><br><a href="starcon.html#c2">Star Classification</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="../astro/astref.html#c1">Ward & Brownlee</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../astro/astcon.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
