It was listed by the Abbé [Abbot]  Nicholas Louis de La Caille (1713-1762), who had the great honor of naming 15 of the 88 constellations by becoming the first astronomer to systematically observe the entire night sky, in his posthumously published 1763 catalogue of 9,766 stars that was compiled from 1750 to 1754 by studying the stars of the southern hemisphere at the Cape of Good Hope, the southernmost point of Africa, with just an half-inch (8x) refractor. Although Lacaille 8760 is the brightest red (more orange-red to some astronomers) dwarf star in Earth's night sky, the star is too faint to be seen with the naked eye by most Humans (Kenneth Croswell, 2002). </p><p>This spectral and luminosity type of this cool and dim, main sequence dwarf has been classed as orange as K7 (SIMBAD) and red as M2 Ve (Hawley et al, 1996). Lacaille 8760 may have around 60 percent of Sol's mass (RECONS), about 66 to 72 percent of its diameter ((Pasinetti-Fracassini et al, 2001;  Johnson and Wright, 1983, page 699; and  Claude H. Lacy, 1977, page 482), and 2.8 to 3.5 percent of its luminosity, and is at least half as abundant in elements heavier than hydrogen ("metallicity") as Sol. A relatively mild flare star (that erupts less than once per day), Lacaille 8760 has been given the Variable Star designation AX Microscopii (B.R. Pettersen;  P.B. Byrne; and Woolley et al, 1970). Given its relatively sedate flare rate and the high eccentricity (e= 0.20) and inclination (i= 0.06) of its orbit around the galactic center (Allen and Herrera, 1998;  P.B. Byrne; and Woolley et al, 1970), the star appears to be older than Sol's 4.6 billion years.(Solstation)</p> <p>Sources:<ul><li><a href="http://www.solstation.com/stars/lac8760.htm">http://www.solstation.com/stars/lac8760.htm</a></ul></p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="strclos-2.html#c0">Nearby Stars</a><br><br><a href="starcon-2.html#c1">Star Concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../astro/astcon.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c3"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Luyten 789-6</H1><p>The system known as Luyten 789-6 is a nearby triple star system (trinary), also known as EZ Aquarii, consisting of three red dwarfs.

The fifth brightest star in Indus, this star is the title member of the Epsilon Indi stellar moving group. Although smaller and dimmer than the Sun, it is clearly visible with the naked eye. Epsilon Indi has such a high proper motion that, within a few thousand years, it will have moved out of Constellation Indus constellation and into neighboring Constellation  Tucana, the Toucan. (Solstation) It moves a full lunar diameter in less than 400 years.(ESO)</p><p>Epsilon Indi is a orange-red main sequence dwarf star of spectral and luminosity type K4-5 Ve. The star has about 77 percent of Sol's mass (RECONS), 76 percent of its diameter (Johnson and Wright, 1983, page 701), and about 14.7 percent of its luminosity. It appears to be about 59 to 110 percent as enriched as Sol with elements heavier than hydrogen ("metallicity"), based on its abundance of iron.(Solstation)</p><p>On January 13, 2003, astronomers announced the discovery of a methane brown dwarf companion to this nearby star  In August 2003, the same team (as well as another team) of astronomers discovered that the brown dwarf had its own brown dwarf companion. As of late 2003, the two substellar objects are the closest known brown dwarfs to the Solar System.(Solstation)  Epsilon Indi B has a mass just 45 times that of Jupiter, the largest planet in the Solar System, and a surface temperature of only 1000 ¡C. It belongs to the so-called 'T dwarf' category of objects which straddle the domain between stars and giant planets.(ESO)</p> <p>Sources:<ul><li><a href="http://www.solstation.com/stars/eps-indi.htm">http://www.solstation.com/stars/eps-indi.htm</a><li>http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2003/pr-01-03.html</li></ul></p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="strclos-2.html#c0">Nearby Stars</a><br><br><a href="starcon-2.html#c1">Star Concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../astro/astcon.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
