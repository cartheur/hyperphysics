Ross 128 would be only one of many unremarkable stars except that it appears to be a flare star as well as one of Sol's closest neighbors. In contrast to  Proxima Centauri which is a "magnetically younger" flare star that is "activity saturated", however, Ross 128 is considered to be a more "evolved" flare star where its flare rate may have decreased somewhat with increased magnetic evolution (Andrew Skumanich, 1986)."(Solstation)</p><p>Sources:<ul><li>http://www.solstation.com/stars/ross128.htm<li>Skumanich http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1986ApJ...309..858S</ul></p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="strclos-2.html#c0">Nearby Stars</a><br><br><a href="starcon-2.html#c1">Star Concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../astro/astcon.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c2"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Ross 154</H1><table><tr><td><img src="imgsta/gl623b-2.gif"></td><td> <p>Ross 154 is a dim, main-sequence red dwarf that is comparable to the two stars, Gliese 623a and the dimmer Gliese 623b,  shown in the NASA HST image at left. </p></td></tr></table><p>"This dim star is the seventh closest to our Sun, lying at about 9.7 light-years (ly) away.

Ross 248 would be only one of many unremarkable stars except that it is one of Sol's closest neighbors. Classified as a flare star, the star also has the variable designation HH Andromedae, and investigators have reported finding possible periods of variability at 4.2 years, 120 or 121 days, and five other periods between 60 and 291 days, which may be caused by an unresolved companion (Edward W. Weiss, 1993, page 1139)."(Solstation) </p> <p>Sources:<ul><li>http://www.solstation.com/stars/ross248.htm<li></ul></p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="strclos-2.html#c0">Nearby Stars</a><br><br><a href="starcon-2.html#c1">Star Concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../astro/astcon.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
