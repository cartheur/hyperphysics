For the <a href="../astro/cepheid.html#c2">Cepheid variables</a>, the period of variation is an indication of the absolute magnitude of the star. It is therefore an important tool for measuring astronomical distances. The <a href="rrlyrae-2.html#c1">RR Lyrae</a> variables also exhibit regular periods. </p><p>There can be a stage of variability late in the red giant phase of a star's life. A whole class of variable stars have been named after the variable star officially known as <a href="ceti-2.html#c1">Omicron Ceti</a> but also widely known as Mira. "Mira-type" stars are variables with a period of around 100 - 1000 days and with visual light variations of more than 2.5 magnitudes. Over 6000 "Mira variables" are now known. </p><p>The extraordinary brightening of a star known as a <a href="../astro/nova.html#c1">nova</a> is thought to be a characteristic of binary systems where there is exchange of mass, perhaps falling into a white dwarf and triggering a sudden burst of fusion. There can be multiple nova events, but not a reproducible period. A <a href="../astro/snovcn.html#c2">supernova</a> is in a class by itself as a singular dramatic stellar event. </p><p>A pattern of regular intensity variation may signal the presence of a <a href="bistar-2.html#c1">binary star</a> or a multiple star system where eclipsing is taking place. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="starcon-2.html#c1">Star Concepts</a><br><br><a href="starcon-2.html#c2">Star Classification</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../astro/astcon.html#c1">  Astrophysics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
