From the actual flight paths of each trip, the theory predicted that the flying clocks, compared with reference clocks at the U.S. Naval Observatory, should have lost 40+/-23 nanoseconds during the eastward trip and should have gained 275+/-21 nanoseconds during the westward trip ... Relative to the atomic time scale of the U.S. Naval Observatory, the flying clocks lost 59+/-10 nanoseconds during the eastward trip and gained 273+/-7 nanosecond during the westward trip, where the errors are the corresponding standard deviations. These results provide an unambiguous empirical resolution of the famous clock "paradox" with macroscopic clocks."</p><p>J.C. Hafele and R. E.

The problem encountered with measuring the difference between a surface clock and one on an aircraft is that neither location is really an inertial frame. If we take the center of the earth as an approximation to an inertial frame, then we can compute the difference between a surface clock and the aircraft clock. Taking a "proper time" at the earth's center as if the master clock were there, the time measured by a clock on the surface would be larger</p><center><img src="imgrel/hake3.gif"></center> <p> and that for the airborne clock would be approximately</p>                             <center><img src="imgrel/hake4.gif"></center><p> since to the level of the approximations used, the height of the aircraft does not significantly change the radius R.
