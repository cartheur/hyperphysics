They measured the flux of <a href="../particles/lepton.html#c3">muons</a> at a location on Mt Washington in New Hampshire at about 2000 m altitude and also at the base of the mountain.  They found the ratio of the muon flux was 1.4, whereas the ratio should have been about 22 even if the muons were traveling at the speed of light, using the muon half-life of 1.56 microseconds. When the <a href="tdil-2.html#c2">time dilation</a> relationship was applied, the result could be explained if the muons were traveling at 0.994 c. </p><p>In an experiment at CERN by Bailey et al., muons of velocity 0.9994c were found to have a lifetime 29.3 times the laboratory lifetime. </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR>References<br><a href="relref-2.html">Rossi, et al. </a><br><br><a href="relref-2.html">Bailey, et al. </a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="relcon-2.html#relcon">     Relativity </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
