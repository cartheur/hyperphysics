As illustrated below, typical dust particles are much smaller than that. As the laser is further focused down to about 1.7 micrometers at the depth of the <a href="cdplay3.html#c1">pits</a>, any shadow from the small defects is blurred and indistinct and does not cause a read error. Larger defects are handled by <a href="#c2">error-correcting codes</a> in the handling of the digital data.  </p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="cd.html#c1">CD concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="audiocon.html#c1">Sound reproduction concepts</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="../sound/souref.html">Rossing</a><br>Physics Teacher, Dec. 87</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../sound/soucon.html">     Sound </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c2"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Error-Correction of CD Signals</H1><p> The data on a <a href="cdplay.html#c1">compact disc</a> is <a href="#c3">encoded </a>in such a way that some well- developed error-correction schemes can be used. A sophisticated error- correction code known as CIRC (cross interleave Reed-Solomon code) is used to deal with both burst errors from dirt and scratches and random errors from inaccurate cutting of the disc. The data on the disc are formatted in frames which contain 408 bits of audio data and another 180 bits of data which include parity and sync bits and a subcode. A given frame can contain information from other frames and the correlation between frames can be used to minimize errors. Errors on the disc could lead to some output frequencies above 22kHz (half the sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz)  which could cause serious problems by "aliasing" down to audible frequencies. A technique called oversampling is used to reduce such noise. Using a digital filter to sample four times and average provides a 6-<a href="../sound/db.html#c1">decibel</a> improvement in signal-to-noise ratio. For more details, see the references. </TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="cd.html#c1">CD concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="audiocon.html#c1">Sound reproduction concepts</a><br><br>References<br><a href="../sound/souref.html">Rossing</a><br>Physics Teacher, Dec. 87<br><br><a href="../sound/souref.html">Myaoka</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../sound/soucon.html">     Sound </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c3"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Data Encoding on Compact Discs</H1>When the <a href="cdplay.html#c2">laser</a> in a <a href="cdplay.html#c1">compact disc player</a> sweeps over the track of <a href="cdplay3.html#c1">pits</a> which represents the data, a transition from a flat area to a pit area or vice versa is interpreted as a binary 1, and the absence of a transition in a time interval called a clock cycle is interpreted as a binary 0. This kind of detection is called an NRZI code. The particular NRZI code used with compact discs is EFM (eight-to-fourteen modulation) in which eight bits of data are represented by fourteen channel bits. In addition to the actual digital sound data, parity and sync bits and a subcode are also recorded on the disc in "frames" . In a given frame, 408 bits of audio data are recorded with another 180 bits of data which permit a sophisticated <a href="#c2">error-correction</a> code to be used. A given frame can contain information from other frames and the correlation between frames can be used to minimize errors. In addition to detection, a significant amount of computation must be done to decode the signal and prepare it for conversion back to analog form with a DAC. </TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="cd.html#c1">CD concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="audiocon.html#c1">Sound reproduction concepts</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="../sound/souref.html">Rossing</a><br>Physics Teacher, Dec. 87</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../sound/soucon.html">     Sound </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c4"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Detection of Compact Disc Data</H1> The <a href="cdplay3.html#c1">pits</a> which encode the digital data on a <a href="cdplay.html#c1">compact disc</a> are <a href="cdplay3.html#c3">tracked</a> by a <a href="cdplay.html#c2">laser</a>. The reflected light from the pits is <a href="cdplay3.html#c5">out of phase</a> with that from the surrounding area, so the reflected light intensity drops when the laser moves over a pit area. The nature of a <a href="cdplay.html#c2">photodiode</a> is such that it can be used as the sensing element in a light-activated switch. It conducts an electric current which is proportional to the light falling on it.  The photodiode and switch can be adjusted so that a transition to a pit area will switch it off, and a transition from a pit area will switch it on. Either transition is interpreted as a binary 1, while the absence of a transition in a given clock cycle is interpreted as a binary zero. The data on the disc is <a href="cdplay4.html#c3">encoded</a> in a sophisticated way, so that decoding is necessary before sending the digital signal representing the sound to a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) for reconversion to analog form. </TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="cd.html#c1">CD concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="audiocon.html#c1">Sound reproduction concepts</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="../sound/souref.html">Rossing</a><br>Physics Teacher, Dec. 87</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../sound/soucon.html">     Sound </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
