That is, it produces an electrical signal that has the same frequency and <a href="../sound/timbre.html#c2">harmonic content</a>, and a size that reflects the relative <a href="../sound/intens.html#c1">intensity</a> of the sound as it changes. The job of the <a href="amp.html#c1">amplifier</a> is to take that electrical image and make it larger -- large enough in power to drive the coils of a loudspeaker. Having a "high fidelity" amplifier means that you make it larger without changing any of its properties. Any changes would be perceived as distortions of the sound since the <a href="../sound/ear.html#c1">human ear</a> is amazingly sensitive to such changes. Once the amplifier has made the electrical image large enough, it applies it to the voice coils of the loudspeaker, making them vibrate with a pattern that follows the variations of the original signal. The voice coil is attached to and drives the cone of the loudspeaker, which in turn drives the air. This action on the air produces sound that more-or-less reproduces the sound pressure variations of the original signal. </p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="#c2">Loudspeaker basics</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="audiocon.html#c1">Sound reproduction concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="spkcon.html#c1">Loudspeaker concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../sound/soucon.html">     Sound </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c2"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Loudspeaker Basics</H1><table><tr><td><p>The loudspeakers are almost always the limiting element on the fidelity of a reproduced sound in either home or theater. The other stages in sound reproduction are mostly electronic, and the electronic components are highly developed. The loudspeaker involves electromechanical processes where the amplified audio signal must move a cone or other mechanical device to produce sound like the original sound wave. This process involves many difficulties, and usually is the most imperfect of the steps in sound reproduction. Choose your speakers carefully. Some basic ideas about speaker enclosures might help with perspective.</p><p> Once you have chosen a good <a href="#c3">loudspeaker</a> from a reputable manufacturer and paid a good price for it, you might presume that you would get good sound reproduction from it. But you won't --- not without a good <a href="#c4">enclosure</a>. The enclosure is an essential part of sound production because of the following problems with a direct radiating loudspeaker: </p></td><td><center><a href="#c3"><img src="imgaud/spk3.gif"></a><br>Click image for more details.</center></td></tr></table></p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="4"><tr><td><a href="spk2.html#c1">The sound from the back of the speaker cone will tend to cancel the sound from the front, especially for low frequencies.</a></td><td><a href="spk2.html#c3">The free cone speaker is very inefficient at producing sound wavelengths longer than the diameter of the speaker.</a> </td></tr><tr><td><a href="spk2.html#c2">Speakers have a free-cone resonant frequency which distorts the sound by responding too strongly to frequencies near resonance. </a></td><td><a href="#c5">More power is needed in the bass range, making multiple drivers with a crossover a practical necessity for good sound.</a> </td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="audiocon.html#c1">Sound reproduction concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="spkcon.html#c1">Loudspeaker concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../sound/soucon.html">     Sound </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c3"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><table><tr><td><img src="imgaud/spk4.gif"></td><td><H1 align=center>Loudspeaker Details</H1><p>An enormous amount of engineering work has gone into the design of today's <a href="#c1">dynamic loudspeaker</a>. A light voice coil is mounted so that it can move freely inside the magnetic field of a strong permanent magnet. The speaker cone is attached to the voice coil and attached with a flexible mounting to the outer ring of the speaker support. Because there is a definite "home" or equilibrium position for the speaker cone and there is elasticity of the mounting structure, there is inevitably a <a href="spk2.html#c2">free cone resonant frequency</a> like that of a <a href="../shm2.html#c1">mass on a spring</a>. The frequency can be determined by adjusting the mass and stiffness of the cone and voice coil, and it can be damped and broadened by the nature of the construction, but that natural mechanical frequency of vibration is always there and enhances the frequencies in the frequency range near resonance. Part of the role of a good <a href="#c4">enclosure</a> is to minimize the impact of this resonant frequency. </p></td></tr></table></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="audiocon.html#c1">Sound reproduction concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="spkcon.html#c1">Loudspeaker concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../sound/soucon.html">     Sound </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A Name="c4"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Types of Enclosures</H1><p>The production of a good high-fidelity loudspeaker requires that the speakers be enclosed because of a number of <a href="#c2">basic properties of loudspeakers</a>.

Modern loudspeaker enclosures typically involve <a href="#c5">multiple loudspeakers</a> with a <a href="cross.html#c1">crossover network</a> to provide a more nearly uniform frequency response across the audio frequency range.

For the production of high frequencies, the driving element should be small and light to be able to respond rapidly to the applied signal. Such high frequency speakers are called "tweeters". On the other hand, a bass speaker should be large to efficiently impedance match to the air. Such speakers, called "woofers", must also be supplied with more power since the signal must drive a larger mass. Another factor is that the ear's response curves discriminate against bass, so that more acoustic power must be supplied in the bass range. It is usually desirable to have a third, mid-range, speaker to achieve a smooth frequency response. The appropriate frequency signals are routed to the speakers by a <a href="cross.html#c1">crossover network</a>.  </p><center><img src="imgaud/spk5.gif"></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><BR><BR><a href="audiocon.html#c1">Sound reproduction concepts</a><BR><BR><a href="spkcon.html#c1">Loudspeaker concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../sound/soucon.html">     Sound </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
