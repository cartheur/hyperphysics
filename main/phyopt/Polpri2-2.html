It is made of two prisms of <a href="biref.html#c4">calcite</a> with no other intervening material, i.e., with air between them. The O-ray is removed and the E-ray continues straight through the device as shown.  </p><img src="imgpho/glanf.gif" usemap="#pp"><p>One of the advantages of the Glan-Foucault prism is that it can handle the high power densities (about 100 watts/cm^2) characteristic of laser work. One disadvantage is a narrow field of view, about 10&#176;. That field of view is widened in the Glan-Thompson prism, which has similar geometry but is cemented together. This extends the angle of view to about 30&#176;, but cuts the maximum continuous power density by a factor of 100 to about 1 watt/cm^2.</p> <p>The presence of the cement in the Glan-Thompson prism means that the angles must be different, since the critical angle for total internal reflection depends upon the indices of refraction of both materials at an interface.</p><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="polpri.html#c1">Polarizing prisms</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="polarcon.html#c1">Polarization concepts</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../ligcon.html#ligcon">     Light and Vision </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
