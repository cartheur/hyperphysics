The expected interference fringe pattern from a single spectral line is a "bullseye" of concentric light and dark rings. If another spectral line is present, a series of independent darker and lighter concentric rings can be seen. The appearance of these rings depends upon the separation of the elements of the interferometer, i.e., the thickness of the air film between the surfaces. Appropriate data can then yield the separation of the spectral wavelengths. </p>     <p>Since the measurement of the H/D doublet requires a well-aligned interferometer, it is good practice to align the spectrometer and measure the sodium doublet as preparation for the H/D measurement.

The Bohr model of the atom predicts that transitions will occur by electron transition between energy levels, leading to wavelengths:</p><center><img src="imgpho/hd1.gif"></center><p>where m is the mass of the electron.
