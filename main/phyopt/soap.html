The color seen depends also upon the angle of view. </p>  <center><img src = "phopic/soapfilm.jpg"></center><p>The image above is courtesy of Eray Canli, at student at Middle East Technical University in Turkey. He made the photo in his optics course project. </p><p>The fringes below were recorded with an 8mm camcorder with a closeup lens attached. The soap film was formed by dipping a loop formed by thumb and forefinger into a concentrated solution of dishwashing detergent. Note that you see red at three different angles, showing that three orders of reflection have been spanned. Bands of color can also be seen if the film thickness is varying.
