One of the most famous historical cases was the revealing of the double helix structure of DNA by the X-ray diffraction studies done by</p><p>Information from diffraction can be demonstrated even by single slit diffraction, since the measurement of the diffraction pattern can give a measure of the slit width. For a double slit, the interference and diffraction can give a measure of the slit separation as well as the slit width. But a more revealing example of the information obtainable from diffraction is the diffraction from a series of tiny apertures arrange in two straight rows, making a shape like a "+" sign. The resulting pattern reveals the 90&#176; angle in the object, and could do so even if the pattern had been too small for you to readily see with your eye.</p><table><tr><td> <center><img src="phopic/millt.jpg"></center></td><td><p>The object consists of tiny apertures in the geometry described obove.
