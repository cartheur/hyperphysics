It was observed in an interstellar cloud in the constellation Ophiuchus, "The Serpent Bearer". The cloud is illuminated from behind by the star <font face="symbol">z</font>-Ophiuci, making possible the observation of CN absorption lines.   <center><img src="imgmol/cnspect.gif"></center><table><tr><td><center><img src="imgmol/cnenergy.gif"></center></td><td><p>An absorption line at 387.5 nm was observed, corresponding to the transition from the j=0 to j=1 rotational state in addition to the larger transition from the ground to excited electronic state. But, surprisingly, another line was observed at a wavelength 0.061 nm shorter and about 1/4 the intensity. Interpreting this transition as the j=1 to j=2 transition required an excitation mechanism, which would involve energy from the surroundings. Using the <a href="../quantum/disfcn.html#c2">Boltzmann distribution</a>, a temperature for the environment could be estimated from the relative intensities of the lines. </p><p>Attributing the excitation to background radiation, the calculation of the required background temperature requires the energy difference (5 x 10<sup>-4</sup> eV from the wavelength difference) and the number of ways each state could be formed (2j+1). The intensity ratio is then the population ratio</p><center><img src="imgmol/cn1.gif"></center><p>This leads to the temperature</p><center><img src="imgmol/cn2.gif"></center></td></tr></table><p>About measurements made in the early 40's, Rohlf quotes the noted molecular spectroscopist Gerhard Herzberg as saying "From the intensity ratio of the [CN] lines with [j=0 and j=1] a rotational temperature of 2.3 K follows, which has of course a very restricted meaning." It was not as restricted as he thought -- 25 years later, Penzias and Wilson would demonstrate the existence of the <a href="../bkg3k.html#c1">cosmic background radiation</a> at 2.7K, an accomplishment for which they received the Nobel Prize. These early spectroscopists had seen evidence of the cosmic background radiation in the relative intensities of observed spectral lines!</p></TD><TD WIDTH="66" align=center><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a><br><br><a href="molspecon.html#c1">Molecular spectra concepts</a><br><br>Reference<br><a href="../quaref.html#c1">Rohlf</a><br>Sec 10-5</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<table><tr><td width= "450"><A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../quacon.html#quacon">     Quantum Physics </A></td><td align=right><font size="-1"><i>R Nave</i></font></td></tr></table></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
