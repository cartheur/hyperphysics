What fraction of 4 MeV alpha particles will scatter between 30&deg;and 40&deg; when directed at a 1 micrometer<BR>thick gold foil? Zgold=79, Agold=197, density=1.93x10^4 kg/m3.<P>For 30 degrees, sigma = pi*(2*79*1.44 MeV fm/(2*4 MeV))^2*(1 + cos 30)/(1- cos 30)<BR>&nbsp;35391.9223 fm^2 = 353.92 barns<P>For 40 degrees, sigma = pi*(2*79*1.44 MeV fm/(2*4 MeV))^2*(1 + cos 40)/(1- cos 40)<BR>&nbsp;19181.26831 fm^2 = 191.8 barns<BR>Net cross section for scattering between 30 and 40 degrees =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;162.10 barns<P>The scattered fraction is then = N*L*density*sigma/(A*1E-3)<BR>&nbsp;Scattered fraction =&nbsp; 0.00095<P>2. a. If 6 MeV alpha particles are back scattered from an aluminum foil,what upper bound on the nuclear<BR>radius of the aluminum nucleus does this yield?(Zalum=14, Aalum=27,density=2.7x103 kg/m3,<BR>1 micrometer thick)<P>Set the kinetic energy equal to the potential energy<BR>6 MeV = 2Zke^2/r , so r = 2*14*1.44 MeV fm/6 MeV=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.72 fm<P>b. If a 6 MeV alpha scatters at 60&deg; when passing through an aluminumfoil, what is its closest approach<BR>&nbsp;to the nucleus?<P>&nbsp;The impact parameter for an angle theta is<BR>&nbsp;b=(kq1q2/mv^2)*(1 + cos theta)/(1 - cos theta) and for 60 degrees<BR>&nbsp;b= ((2)(14)(1.44 MeV fermi)/(2*6 MeV))*sqrt((1 + cos 60)/(1 -cos 60)) =<BR>&nbsp;b= 5.82 fermi<P>&nbsp;b. The closest approach is given by<BR>&nbsp;rm = Zke^2/KE + .5*sqrt((2Zke^2/KE)^2 + 4b^2) =<BR>&nbsp; =14*1.44/6 + sqrt((2*14*1.44/6)^2 +4b^2) =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.08 fermi<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>3. If the kinetic energy of a scattered particle is large enough, thenits scattering can be treated just like<BR>the Compton scattering of a photon.<P>a. For scattering of a 4 MeV electron from a medical radiation therapyaccelerator off a proton, what<BR>percentage error is made by assuming that KE=pc?<BR>pc=sqrt((4 MeV+.511MeV)^2-.511MeV^2) =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.481963855MeV<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.025 % error<P>b. Using the Compton scattering approach, what kinetic energy will ascattered electron have if it scatters<BR>&nbsp;off a proton at 60&deg;?<BR>Using the assumption pc=KE before and after, even knowing that thereis significant error, gives:<BR>&nbsp;hc/pcf - hc/pci=(h/mc)*(1-cos 60)<BR>&nbsp;hc/pcf= 310.661<BR>&nbsp;pcf= 3.9915 MeV<BR>The only rationale for carrying out such a calculation is that it ismuch easier than carrying out<BR>the full relativistic conservation of momentum and energy calculationfor a particle for which v/c=.99356 .<P>It does in fact provide useful information: that the scattering is essentiallyelastic since there is very little<BR>&nbsp;momentum change for the electron.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;</BODY>
