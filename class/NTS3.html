Why doesn't it crush thecar top in?</p><p>How do you find the pressure at a depth in a fluid?</p><p>If you dive to a depth of 10 meters, how much additional pressure is exerted upon you?</p><p>What is Pascal's Principle? </p><p>What is a hydraulic press and what is itgood for? How is Pascal's Principle used in the hydraulic press?</p><p>Can a hydraulic press multiply force? Can it cause something to move further than theforce which is applied to the press? Can itdo both at the same time?</p><p>What is the Bernoulli Principle?</p><p>Is there really such a thing as a curveball pitch in baseball, or is it an optical illusion? How can theBernoulli Principle cause a ball to curve?What is Archimedes' Principle?</p><p>What was the basis for Archimedes' conclusionthat the king's crown was not made out ofsolid gold?</p><p>How can you make use of the buoyant force on an object to determine its density?</p><p>If your heart were not pumping enough blood throughan artery to supply your body's needs, what could bechanged to increase the flowrate?</p><p>If you could increase the blood pressure by 10%, orincrease the radius of the artery by 10%, which would be more effective in increasing blood flow?</p><p>If an artery started to expand because its wall was too weak to withstand the internal blood pressure, would that expansion relieve the stress or tension of the artery wall?</p><p>What is the origin of the force which pushesthe mercury up in a barometer?</p><p>What force pushes a liquid up a drinking straw?</p><p>What force moves air into your lungs whenyou breathe?</p></td><td>*<a href="../press.html#pre">Pressure definition</a><BR><BR>*<a href="../pman.html#atm">Atmospheric pressure</a><BR><BR><BR>*<a href= "../pflu.html#fp" >fluid pressure</a><BR><BR>*<a href= "../pasc.html#pp" >Pascal's principle</a><BR><BR><BR>*<a href= "../pasc.html#hpress" >hydraulic press</a><BR><BR>*<a href= "../pasc2.html#brake" >hydraulic brakes</a><BR><BR><BR>*<a href= "../pasc.html#car" >auto lift</a><BR><BR>*<a href="../pber.html#beq">Bernoulli equation</a><BR><BR><BR>*<a href="../pber.html#base">Baseball curve</a><BR><BR>*<a href= "../pbuoy.html#arch3" >Archimedes' principle</a><BR><BR><BR>*<a href= "../pbuoy.html#buoy" >buoyancy</a><BR><BR>*<a href= "../ppois.html#poi" >Poiseuille's law</a><BR><BR>*Blood pressure<BR><BR>*<a href="../ptens.html#bal">LaPlace's law</a><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>*<a href= "../pman.html#bar" >barometer</a><BR><BR>*Drinking through straw<BR><BR>*Breathing pressure<BR><BR>*<a href="../kinetic/idegas.html#c1">Ideal gas law<BR><BR></td></tr></table></TD><TD WIDTH="66"><a href="../hframe.html">Index</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="nts3001-4.html#c1">     NSCI 3001</A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
