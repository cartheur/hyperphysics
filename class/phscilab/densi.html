This difference is characterized by another property, <a href="../../dens.html#dens">density</a>. Density is defined as the ratio of an object's mass to its volume: </p>					<center><table><tr><td width="300"><table><tr><td><font size="+1">d= m/v</font></td><td><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="../../dens.html#dens">Calculation</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td><td width="20">					(1)</td></tr></table></center><p>Since it is rare to find two different substances with identical densities, density is of value in helping to identify materials.</p>	    <p>The specific gravity of a substance is defined as the ratio of the density of the substance to the density of water (1 gram/cm<sup>3</sup>). This ratio is a convenient physical property since it has no units and is therefore independent of the system of measure you use to determine it. </p><p><a href="../../pbuoy.html#arch3">Archimedes' principle</a> states that the <a href="../../pbuoy.html#buoy">buoyant force</a> experienced by a submerged object is equal to the weight of the liquid displaced by the object. Experimentally this appears in the fact that the submerged object apparently weighs less by an amount equal to the weight of the liquid displaced.

Record the new water level.</p><p> Determine the volume of the metal and recalculate the density using this volume and the mass from part I.</p><p>III. Testing of Archimedes' principle with metal sample. </p><p>1. Make use of the movable platform on the pan balance to support the graduated cylinder of water. Hang the metal cylinder on the hook above the pan so that  the metal is suspended and submerged in the water without touching the sides. Determine its apparent mass using the scale. Find the difference between the actual and apparent masses and compare this to the mass of the water displaced using relationship (3).</p><center><img src="imglab/tiecyl.gif"></center><p>IV. Measurement of rock sample densities using Archimedes principle.</p><p>1. Two rock samples will be supplied. One is a light-colored rock typical of the material of which the continents are made, and the other is a dark basaltic rock characteristic of the ocean floors. Carefully determine the mass of each with the pan balance. This mass determination should be made while the rocks are dry- they will pick up a significant mass of water when wet.</p><p>2. Tie a light string on each sample so that they can be suspended from the hook above the pan of the balance. Fill a beaker with enough water to submerge the sample and use Archimedes principle to determine the density of each rock.</p><A Name="c2"></A><h2 align="center">Data Sheet - Density and Buoyancy</h2><p>I.
