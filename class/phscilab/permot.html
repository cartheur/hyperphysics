<HEAD>   <TITLE>Periodic Motion</TITLE></HEAD><body bgcolor="#FFE4C8"><A Name="c1"></A><TABLE WIDTH="580" HEIGHT="370" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD WIDTH="514" HEIGHT="309"><H1 align=center>Introduction to Periodic Motion</H1><p>&nbsp;All methods of production of musical sound depend upon the abilityto produce periodic motion in some mechanical device which in turn producessound.&nbsp; The important terms associated with periodic motion are frequency,period and amplitude.&nbsp; The frequency (f) is in cycles per second orHertz and the period (T) is the number of seconds to complete one cycleor "seconds/cycle".&nbsp; The period, T, in seconds per cycle = 1/f.&nbsp;The amplitude is the maximum displacement away from the equilibrium position(the place where the object would normally rest).&nbsp; For example, thenormal rest position of a violin string is its equilibrium position.&nbsp;The intensity produced by the string is related to the amplitude of itsmotion.<p>&nbsp;One of the most common examples of periodic motion is the pendulum.&nbsp;Although it is not directly related to a sound source, it will serve todemonstrate some of the features of periodic motion.&nbsp; We will studythe frequency of the pendulum as a function of the mass, length, and amplitudeand plot graphs of the dependence upon these parameters.<p>Procedure<p>1. Suspend the 200g mass provided to form a pendulum of length 150cm(measure from the center of mass to the point of support).&nbsp; Measurethe time required to complete 10 full cycles to the nearest tenth of asecond.&nbsp; Repeat for pendulum lengths of 100, 75, 50, and 25 cm.&nbsp;Calculate the period in seconds/cycle and the squares of the periods.&nbsp;Plot the period squared vs&nbsp; the length on the graph paper provided.<p>&nbsp;Length&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TotalTime&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Period&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Period Squared<p>&nbsp;150 cm __________&nbsp; ________&nbsp; ____________<p>&nbsp;100 cm __________&nbsp; ________&nbsp; ____________<p>&nbsp;75 cm __________&nbsp; ________&nbsp; ____________<p>&nbsp;50 cm __________&nbsp; ________&nbsp; ____________<p>&nbsp;25 cm __________&nbsp; ________&nbsp; ____________<br>&nbsp;<p>2. Using successive masses 100, 200, and 500 grams, make a pendulumof length 50 cm and determine the corresponding periods.&nbsp; Since differentmasses cause different amounts of stretching of the string, the lengthshould be adjusted to exactly 50 cm and remeasured for each mass. The lengthshould be measured to the center of the hanging mass.<p>&nbsp;Mass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100 gm&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 200 gm&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 500gm<p>&nbsp;Period __________&nbsp; ________&nbsp; ____________<p>&nbsp; Plot the period as a function of the mass.<p>3. Using the 100 gm mass and a length of 50 cm, pull the pendulum bobout a distance of approximately 15 cm (straight line measure) and measurethe period of the resulting motion when released.&nbsp; Repeat for 30,45, and 60 cm.&nbsp; These distances may be measured by placing one endof the meter stick at the equilibrium point and measuring the straightline distance to the mass.&nbsp; Record the period.<br>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;Amplitudes: 15 cm&nbsp; _______&nbsp; 30 cm&nbsp; _______&nbsp;45 cm&nbsp; ________&nbsp; 60 cm&nbsp; ________<br>&nbsp;<p>4. Using the graph made in part 1, predict the period of a 125 cm pendulum.&nbsp;Measure the period and compare.&nbsp; What mass and amplitude should youuse?<p>&nbsp;Predicted period&nbsp;&nbsp; ____________<p>&nbsp;Measured period&nbsp;&nbsp; ____________<p>5. How strongly does the period of a pendulum depend upon the mass ofthe bob and the amplitude of the swing?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<p>6. If you had a pendulum type clock which was running too slow whatcould you do to correct it?<A Name="c3"></A><h2 align="center">Equipment: Periodic Motion</center></h2><ul><li>Vertical rod, pendulum hanger, table clamp.</li><li>Set of masses including 100, 200 and 500 grams.</li><li>2-meter stick</li><li>Stopwatch</li></ul><center><img src="imglab/pendulumplot.gif"></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66"><a href="../../hframe.html">Index</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<A HREF="../../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="../../sound/p2030.html">     Physics 2030K </A>*****<A HREF="../p2030lab-2.html">     Physics 2030K  Laboratory</A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
