This difference is characterized by another property, <a href="../../dens.html#dens">density</a>. Density is defined as the ratio of an object's mass to its volume: </p>					<center><table><tr><td width="300"><table><tr><td><font size="+1">d= m/v</font></td><td><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="../../dens.html#dens">Calculation</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td><td width="20">					(1)</td></tr></table></center><p>Since it is rare to find two different substances with identical densities, density is of value in helping to identify materials.</p>	    <p>The specific gravity of a substance is defined as the ratio of the density of the substance to the density of water (1 gram/cm^3). This ratio is a convenient physical property since it has no units and is therefore independent of the system of measure you use to determine it. </p><p><a href="../../pbuoy.html#arch3">Archimedes' principle</a> states that the <a href="../../pbuoy.html#buoy">buoyant force</a> experienced by a submerged object is equal to the weight of the liquid displaced by the object. Experimentally this appears in the fact that the submerged object apparently weighs less by an amount equal to the weight of the liquid displaced. The buoyant force can be expressed as </p><center><table><tr><td width="300"><table><tr><td><img src="imglab/buo1-3.gif"></td><td><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="../../dens.html#dens">Calculation</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td><td width="20">					(2)</td></tr></table></center>		                                        			<p>where d is the density of the liquid, g is the acceleration of gravity and v is the volume of the immersed object (or the immersed part of the body if it floats).

Record the new water level.</p><p>3. Determine the volume of the metal and recalculate the density using this volume and the mass from part I.</p><p>III. Testing of Archimedes' principle with metal sample. </p><p>1. Make use of the movable platform on the pan balance to support the graduated cylinder of water. Hang the metal cylinder on the hook above the pan so that  the metal is suspended and submerged in the water without touching the sides. Determine its apparent mass using the scale. Find the difference between the actual and apparent masses and compare this to the mass of the water displaced using relationship (3).</p><center><img src="imglab/tiecyl-3.gif"></center><p>IV. Measurement of mineral sample densities using Archimedes principle.</p><p>1. Two mineral samples will be supplied. One is a light-colored mineral typical of the material of which the continents are made, and the other is a dark basaltic mineral characteristic of the ocean floors. Carefully determine the mass of each with the pan balance. This mass determination should be made while the rocks are dry- they will pick up a significant mass of water when wet.</p><p>2. Tie a light string on each sample so that they can be suspended from the hook above the pan of the balance. Fill a beaker with enough water to submerge the sample and use Archimedes principle to determine the density of each mineral.</p><p>V. Determination of liquid density by mass and volume measurement.</p><p>1. Determine the mass of your graduated cylinder while dry and then fill about half full with the unknown liquid supplied.</p><p>2. Measure the liquid volume and determine the liquid density.</p><p>VI. Determination of liquid density using Archimedes principle.</p><p>1. Suspend the cylindrical metal sample in the liquid as in part III and measure its apparent mass when submerged.</p><p>2. Use Archimedes principle to determine the liquid density. </p><A Name="c2"></A><h2 align="center">Data Sheet - Density and Buoyancy</h2><p>I.
