Some of the detectors in particle accelerators measure particle energyby the amount of curvature of the charged<BR>particles. If you have 1 MeV protons entering a 1 Tesla magnetic fieldand being bent into a quarter of a circle, how far along<BR>the beam axis from the entrance port must you put your detector? Ifyou want to use finite detectors such that the difference<BR>in energy at the adjacent detector is 0.05 MeV, how close must theadjacent detector be to the 1 MeV detector?<P>Using mv^2/r = qvB, the radius of curvature is given by r=mv/qB<BR>Neglecting relativistic corrections, v = sqrt(2E/m) = c*sqrt(2E/mc^2)= c*sqrt(2 MeV/938 MeV) =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13852712.9m/s<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v = 1.39E+07 m/s<BR>Radius of path = mv/qB =&nbsp; 0.145 meters<P>Doing the same calculation for 1.05 MeV gives v=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.42E+07m/s<BR>and radius of path r =&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.148 meters<P>So detector separation =&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.00365 m = 0.365 cm<BR>&nbsp;<P>2. The element potassium is reported to have one of the larger atomicradii, and may be a counterexample<BR>to Rohlf's universal 0.3 nm atom. If the density of solid is 0.86 gm/cm3and its molar mass is 39.1 grams,<BR>calculate the atomic radius.

If four terrorists make it by airport security on a given day ata sizable airport with 50,000 passengers per day, what<BR>is the probability that you can keep any from getting by that securityfor a week?<P>This is a Poisson distribution problem where the probability p for agiven day is 4/50000 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.00008<BR>For a week the number n is 50,000*7 = 350,000 passengers, so the averageexpected is np = 28 = a<BR>The probability for zero is exp(-a) = exp(-28) =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.91 E-13<BR>&nbsp;<P>4. Lay out all the possible ways that 5 particles can have 3 units ofenergy, and calculate the number of states associated<BR>with each configuration. Find the average population for each stateas a way of demonstrating that the population goes down<BR>steeply with increasing energy, leading to the Boltzmann distribution.<BR>&nbsp;<BR><table><tr><td>Energy =</td><td>0 </td><td>1</td><td>2 </td><td>3</td><td> Weighting</td></tr><tr><td>Number of part.</td><td> 4</td><td> 0</td><td>0</td><td> 1</td><td><center>5</center></td></tr><tr><td>Number of part.</td><td> 3</td><td> 1</td><td>1</td><td> 0</td><td><center>20</center></td></tr><tr><td>Number of part.</td><td> 2</td><td> 3</td><td>0</td><td> 0</td><td><center>10</center></td></tr></table><P>Average population<BR>E=0 (4*5 + 3*20 + 2*10 )/35 =&nbsp; 2.857<BR>E=1 (1*20 + 3*10 )/35 =&nbsp; 1.429<BR>E=2 (1*20 )/35 =&nbsp; 0.571<BR>E=3 (1*5&nbsp; )/35 =&nbsp; 0.143<BR>&nbsp;<P>5. Deuterium-tritium fusion to form an alpha particle and a neutronoffers probably the greatest hope for<BR>generating electricity by nuclear fusion.

In a helium-neon laser, the excited helium atoms must collide withneon atoms to transfer energy for the "lasing" neon<BR>transition. The gas in the laser tube is 85% helium and 15% neon atabout 1/300 of an atmosphere, with helium being<BR>used as a "pumping" gas. If the temperature of the gas is 400 K and15% of the gas in the tube is neon, how many collisions<BR>per second does a helium atom make with a neon atom? (Although it isnot really a valid assumption, you may assume that<BR>both types of atoms have Rohlf's nominal diameter of 0.3 nm. You mayalso just assume that the gas is helium for the basic<BR>frequency of collision calculation, and then assume 15% of the collisionsare with neon.)<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Atomic mass of helium = 4.0 u, that of neon = 20.18 u , but that won'tbe used.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Average speed =&nbsp; sqrt(8kT/pi*m) = sqrt(8*1.38e-23*400/(Pi()*4.0*1.66e-27))=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1454.98 m/s<P>In calculating the mean free path, we will have to adjust the volumeper mole to account for the pressure of 1/300 atmos.<BR>Volume per mole = 0.0224 m^3 *(400/273)*300 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.846&nbsp; m^3<P>Mean free path= volume per atom/cross section for collision = 9.846m^3/(pi*(.3nm)^2*6.02e23*1e-18)<P>&nbsp;mean free path= 5.78 E-05 m<P>Rate of collisions = average speed/mean free path =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.52E+07&nbsp; /s<P>Rate of collisions with neon atoms = 15% of collisions =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.77E+06&nbsp; /s</BODY>
