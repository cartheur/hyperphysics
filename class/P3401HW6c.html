Cross-section for scattering angles greater than 10 degrees.<BR>The electron kinetic energy is needed. For pc=200 MeV<BR>&nbsp;KE=sqrt((200 MeV)^2+938.27^2) - 938.27 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21.08MeV<BR>&nbsp;For aluminum with Z=13, the cross section is given by<BR>&nbsp;sigma= pi b^2 = pi(Zke^2/2 KE)^2(1 + cos theta)/(1 - cos theta)<BR>&nbsp; = pi*(13*1.44 MeV fm)/(2*21 MeV))^2*(1 + cos 10)/(1-cos 10)=<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 81.00 fm^2 or 0.810 barns<P>b. For foil 1E-6 m thick, what fraction scattered at greater than 10degrees.<BR>&nbsp;The fraction scattered is<BR>&nbsp;Rs/Ri = sigma* Avogadro's number*pathlength*density/(atomic mass*1E-3kg) p176 Rohlf<BR>&nbsp; = (81E-30*6E23*1E-6*2.7E3)/(27*1E-3) =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.86E-06<P>#14. What thickness of air would have the same cross-section as a 0.2E-6meter thick gold foil?<BR>&nbsp;The scattering rate is proportional to the pathlength times density.<BR>&nbsp;The density of air is about 1.2 kg/m^3 while that of gold is19000 kg/m^3.<BR>&nbsp;The pathlength of air to be equivalent to the foil is then<BR>&nbsp;Air length equivalent = (2E-7 m)(19E3 kg/m^3)/(1.2 kg/m^3)*(14/197)*=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.000225042 m<BR>&nbsp;Using 14 is treating air as mostly nitrogen, and you would scatteroff one N, even in N2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.225 mm<BR>&nbsp;So about .2 mm of air is equivalent in alpha scattering to thegold foil,<BR>&nbsp;so you would definitely have to perform the experiment in vacuum.<P>#15.
