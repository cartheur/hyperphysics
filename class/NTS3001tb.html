Each discipline will bring the concepts and examples from their discipline to bear on the theme. The overall theme which has been chosen is a house with the surrounding grounds and environment. This theme brings variety and familiarity, an almost limitless set of examples of the concepts of science in a context which gaurantees connectedness with the student's experience.</p><p>This is a beginning attempt to related the theme to the basic concepts of physics and astronomy.</p><Table Border ="2"CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td width="232" colspan="2"><center>Week 1</center></td><TD WIDTH="5"  noborder></TD><td width="232" colspan="2"><center>Week 2</center></td></tr><TR><TD WIDTH="114" HEIGHT="52"><a href="nts1-3.html#c1">Day 1</a> Aug 23<BR><BR> Measurement Ch 1</center><br>Your home in the universe.
