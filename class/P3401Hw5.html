Debroglie wavelengths<BR>a. wavelength of photon with energy 10 eV<BR>&nbsp;wavelength =hc/E =&nbsp; 1.24E-07 m<BR>&nbsp;A typical Rohlf approach would be to use hc = 1240 eV nm to<BR>&nbsp;get wavelength =1240 eV nm/10 eV = 124 nm<BR>b. Electron with kinetic energy 6 MeV<BR>&nbsp;This is clearly relativistic, so use wavelength = h/p = hc/pc<BR>&nbsp;Using the relativistic energy expression E=sqrt((pc)^2+(m0c^2)^2)<BR>&nbsp;you get wavelength = hc/sqrt(E^2 -(m0c^2)^2)<BR>&nbsp;where a KE=6MeV gives E=6.511MeV.<BR>&nbsp;wavelength = 1240/sqrt(6.511E6^2 - .511E6^2)=&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.000191036nm<BR>c. a neutron with momentum 1 keV/c<BR>&nbsp; pc = 1 keV, so wavelength = h/p=hc/pc=1240eVnm/1000 eV = 1.24nm<BR>d. a neutrino with energy 1 GeV<BR>&nbsp;Since the mass energy is nearly zero if not identically zero,the neutrino<BR>&nbsp;can be treated the same way as the photon in part a.<BR>&nbsp;wavelength =hc/E =1240 eV nm/1E9 eV =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.00000124nm<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 1.24 fermi<P>#2.

The separation between molecules at 300K is about 3.45 nm<BR>&nbsp;so the separation is about&nbsp;&nbsp; 34.56274401 x the wavelength.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>#13. Davisson Germer experiment<BR>&nbsp;The Bragg condition for diffraction is n* wavelength = 2d sintheta<BR>&nbsp;The scattering angle is measured to be 50 degrees, so theta =90-25 = 65 degrees<BR>&nbsp;The electron energy is 54 eV, so we need to calculate wavelengthfrom that.<BR>&nbsp;wavelength = h/p = h/sqrt(2mE) = hc/sqrt(2 mc^2 E)<BR>&nbsp;wavelength = 1240 eV nm/sqrt(2*511000*54) =&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.166916534nm<BR>&nbsp;Assuming first order, n=1, d = wavelength/(2*sin theta) =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.092086009 nm<BR>&nbsp;<BR>#17.
