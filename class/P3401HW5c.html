Debroglie wavelengths<BR>a. wavelength of photon with energy 10 eV<BR>&nbsp;wavelength =hc/E =&nbsp; 1.24E-07 m<BR>&nbsp;A typical Rohlf approach would be to use hc = 1240 eV nm to<BR>&nbsp;get wavelength =1240 eV nm/10 eV = 124 nm<BR>b. Electron with kinetic energy 6 MeV<BR>&nbsp;This is clearly relativistic, so use wavelength = h/p = hc/pc<BR>&nbsp;Using the relativistic energy expression E=sqrt((pc)^2+(m0c^2)^2)<BR>&nbsp;you get wavelength = hc/sqrt(E^2 -(m0c^2)^2)<BR>&nbsp;where a KE=6MeV gives E=6.511MeV.<BR>&nbsp;wavelength = 1240/sqrt(6.511E6^2 - .511E6^2)=&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.000191036nm<BR>c. a neutron with momentum 1 keV/c<BR>&nbsp; pc = 1 keV, so wavelength = h/p=hc/pc=1240eVnm/1000 eV = 1.24nm<BR>d. a neutrino with energy 1 GeV<BR>&nbsp;Since the mass energy is nearly zero if not identically zero,the neutrino<BR>&nbsp;can be treated the same way as the photon in part a.<BR>&nbsp;wavelength =hc/E =1240 eV nm/1E9 eV =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.00000124nm<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 1.24 fermi<P>#2. Kinetic energies for particles of given wavelengths<BR>a. Electron with wavelength 0.1 nm<BR>&nbsp;Try to cast in the units eV and nm.<BR>&nbsp;Kinetic energy = p^2/2m for this non-relativistic electron<BR>&nbsp;KE = h^2/(2m*wavelength)^2 = (hc)^2/(2mc^2*wavelength^2)<BR>&nbsp; =(1240eV nm)^2/(2*0.511e6 eV* (0.1nm)^2)=&nbsp;&nbsp; 150.4501eV<P>&nbsp;If the electron were relativistic we could use E=sqrt((pc)^2+(m0c^2)^2)to<BR>&nbsp;get E and then get kinetic energy from E-m0c^2<BR>&nbsp;This wavelength gives pc=hc/wavelength = 12400 eV<BR>&nbsp;Using rest mass energy .511 MeV we get kinetic energy<BR>&nbsp;150.4280 eV, so to the accuracy of the constants used, theyare the same.<P>b. photon with wavelength 0.1nm<BR>&nbsp;The photon kinetic energy is given simply by pc=hc/wavelength=1240eV nm/.1nm<BR>&nbsp;KE= 12.4 keV<P>c. alpha particle with wavelength 1 fm<BR>&nbsp;The mass of the alpha particle =3730 MeV<BR>&nbsp;For a 1 fm wavelength pc=hc/wavelength=1240eV nm/1E-6nm<BR>&nbsp;pc= 1240000000 eV= 1240 MeV<BR>&nbsp;The energy is then =&nbsp; 3930.712404 MeV<BR>&nbsp;The kinetic energy is then =&nbsp; 200.7124036 MeV<BR>&nbsp;Using the non-relativistic expression p^2/2m , even with relativisticmass and<BR>&nbsp;momentum gives = (1240MeV-fm)^2/(2*3730MeV*(1fm)^2) =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;206.1126005 MeV<P>#5. Electron voltage to be same wavelength as 40 keV x-rays<BR>&nbsp;pc=40keV=hc/wavelength =1.24keV nm/wavelength<BR>&nbsp;wavelength = 0.031 nm<BR>&nbsp;For the electron to have this wavelength, pc=hc/wavelength=1240eVnm/.031 nm<BR>&nbsp;pc = 40000 eV, I.e., pc is&nbsp; the same for the photon andelectron<BR>&nbsp;The electron energy is =&nbsp; 512563.1668 eV<BR>&nbsp;So the electron kinetic energy=&nbsp; 1563.166839 eV<P>&nbsp;The non-relativistic KE expression p^2/2m gives&nbsp;&nbsp; 1565.55773<BR>&nbsp;so this is essentially a non-relativistic electron.<BR>&nbsp;Bottom line: 1563 volts of acceleration gives electron 0.1nmwavelength<P>#7. Kinetic energies of electrons, neutrons and photons of wavelength0.01 nm<BR>Note that the product pc is going to be the same for all three, andthat the kinetic energy<BR>can be calculated from pc.<BR>&nbsp;pc= hc/wavelength = 1240 eV nm/0.01 nm = 124000 eV<BR>&nbsp;a. electron<BR>&nbsp;Kinetic energy = E - m0c^2 = sqrt((pc)^2+(m0c^2)^2) -m0c^2<BR>&nbsp; =sqrt(124000^2 + 511000^2) - 511000^2 =&nbsp;&nbsp; 14829.8eV<P>&nbsp;b. neutron<BR>&nbsp;neutron is non-relativistic.<BR>&nbsp;E = p^2/2m = (hc)^2/(2 m0c^2 * wavelength^2) = 1240^2/(2*939.6E6*(.01)^2)<BR>&nbsp;E= 8.18 eV<P>&nbsp;c. photon<BR>&nbsp;For the photon, KE = pc = 124 keV<P>#8. Debroglie wavelength vs average separation of N2 molecule<BR>&nbsp;a. Taking a temperature of 300K, the average speed of nitrogenmolecules<BR>&nbsp;can be obtained from the Maxwell speed distribution<BR>&nbsp;avg speed sqrt(8kT/m*pi)=&nbsp; 476.29 m/s<P>&nbsp;The wavelength can be put in the form wavelength=h/mv=c(hc/mc^2v)<BR>&nbsp; =c*1240eV nm /(28*931.5E6*476.28)=&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.0299 nm<P>&nbsp;b. The separation between molecules at 300K is about 3.45 nm<BR>&nbsp;so the separation is about&nbsp;&nbsp; 115.21 x the wavelength.<P>#13. Davisson Germer experiment<BR>&nbsp;The Bragg condition for diffraction is n* wavelength = 2d sintheta<BR>&nbsp;The scattering angle is measured to be 50 degrees, so theta =90-25 = 65 degrees<BR>&nbsp;The electron energy is 54 eV, so we need to calculate wavelengthfrom that.<BR>&nbsp;wavelength = h/p = h/sqrt(2mE) = hc/sqrt(2 mc^2 E)<BR>&nbsp;wavelength = 1240 eV nm/sqrt(2*511000*54) =&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.1669nm<BR>&nbsp;Assuming first order, n=1, d = wavelength/(2*sin theta) =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.0921 nm<P>#17. Speed uncertainty of proton located to 1 nm precision.<BR>&nbsp;delta p = hbar/(2 delta x) , delta x = 1 nm<BR>&nbsp;delta v = hbar/(2 m delta x) = c hbar*c/(2 mc^2 delta x)<BR>&nbsp; =3e8 * 197 eV nm/(2* 938E6*1E-9)=&nbsp;&nbsp; 31.50 m/s<P>#20. Electron and proton in atomic-sized volume.<BR>&nbsp;Using the 3D particle in a box expression, the average KE isgiven by<BR>&nbsp;minimum avg KE = 9 hbar^2/2mL^2<BR>&nbsp;This is for a cube of dimension L, so V=L^3 and L^2=V^(2/3)<BR>&nbsp;For V=10e-30 m^3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; L^2 =&nbsp; 1E-20 m^2<BR>&nbsp;electron avg KE = 5.49269E-18 joules= 34.329 eV<BR>&nbsp;proton avg KE= 2.99631E-21 joules= 0.019 eV<BR>&nbsp;Note that just the uncertainty principle gives the order of magnitude<BR>&nbsp;of electrons in atoms, whereas it suggests that protons couldjust wander<BR>&nbsp;in and out of such a volume under the influence of thermal energy.<P>#23. Fractional width of the tau lepton.<BR>&nbsp;From the uncertainty principle in terms of energy,<BR>&nbsp;lambda = hbar/tau, tau given as 3E-13 seconds<BR>&nbsp;lambda = 6.59E-16/3E-13 =&nbsp; 0.00220 eV<BR>&nbsp;Since the energy is 1.8E9, the fractional width is 2.2E-3/1.8E9=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.22 E-12<P>#24. Size of confinement correlated with v/c = 0.5.<BR>&nbsp;If you treat the particle like a standing wave in a one dimensionalbox<BR>&nbsp;so that the wave has value zero at the walls, this gives wavelength= 2L<BR>&nbsp;Then pc=hc/2L and the particle&nbsp; speed is given by v/c =pc/E=pc/(gamma m0c^2)<BR>&nbsp;For v/c = .5, gamma = 1.15.<BR>&nbsp;The dimension L is than given by L = hc/2pc = hc/2(beta*gamma*m0c^2)<BR>&nbsp;for electron, L=1240MeV fm/(2*.5*1.15*0.511MeV) =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2110.1 fm<BR>&nbsp;for muon, L=1240MeV fm/(2*.5*1.15*106MeV) =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.17 fm<BR>&nbsp;for charm quark, L=1240MeV fm/(2*.5*1.15*1500MeV) =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.7188 fm<P>#25. Kinetic energy for electron confined to nucleus.<BR>&nbsp;If we take the nuclear size to be 2 fermi<BR>&nbsp;delta p c = hbar c/2 delta x,<BR>&nbsp;delta pc = 197 MeV fm/ 4 =&nbsp;&nbsp; 49.25 MeV This is toolow a value<BR>&nbsp;Taking&nbsp; delta pc = pc and calculating KE gives&nbsp;&nbsp;48.74 MeV for kinetic energy<BR>&nbsp;<P>&nbsp;Using the 3D particle in a box expression, the average KE is givenby<BR>&nbsp;minimum avg KE = 9 hbar^2/2mL^2<BR>&nbsp;This gives an energy of&nbsp;&nbsp; 85441.1 MeV<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>#28. Width of the K meson.<BR>&nbsp;From the uncertainty principle in energy,<BR>&nbsp;lambda = hbar/tau , tau = 8.9E-9 sec<BR>&nbsp;lambda=6.59E-16 eV s/8.9E-9 =&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.40E-08 eV</BODY>
