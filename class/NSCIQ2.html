If equal masses of copper and water are heated from 10&deg;C to 20&deg;C<BR>a. more heat will be required for the copper<b><font size="+1"><BR><a href="../thermo/inteng.html#c4">b. more heat will be required for the water</a></b></font><BR>c. the same amount of heat will be required for each<P>2. If a mass of hot metal shot is dumped into a cool cup of water andallowed to reach a final temperature<b><font size="+1"><BR><a href="../thermo/coohot.html#c1">a. the amount of heat lost by the metal shot is equal to the heat gainedby the water</a></b></font><BR>b. the heat loss by the metal shot is greater than that gained by thewater<BR>c. the amount of heat gained or lost by the copper and water are notrelated since they are very different substances<P>3. When you measure the temperature of an object with a thermometer,this temperature is a measure of<BR>a. the total energy of the molecules of the object<BR>b. the potential energy which holds the molecules together<b><font size="+1"><BR><a href="../thermo/temper.html#c1">c. the energy of the motion of the molecules</b></a></font><BR>d. the amount of heat possessed by the object<P>4. The amount of heat required to increase the temperature of one gramof water by 1&deg;C is called a calorie. The amount of heat required tomelt a gram of ice at 0&deg;C into a gram of water at 0&deg;C is<b><font size="+1"><BR><a href="../thermo/phase.html#c1">a. much more than a calorie</a></b></font><BR>b. much less than a calorie<BR>c. about a calorie<BR>d. nonsense! You can't have water and ice both at 0&deg;C<P>5. If you have&nbsp; a piece of wood and a piece of metal at the sametemperature, 0&deg;C, which would feel colder to the touch and why?<BR>&nbsp;<p>Even though the wood and metal are at the same temperature, the metal has higher <a href="../thermo/woodmet.html#c1">thermal conductivity</a>. This implies that it will conduct heat from your finger faster and feel colder.</p><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>6. A refrigerator<BR>&nbsp;a. produces cold<BR>&nbsp;b. causes heat to vanish<BR>&nbsp;<a href="../thermo/refrig.html#c1"><b>c. removes heat from a region and transports it to a warmer region</b></a><BR>&nbsp;d. changes heat to cold<BR>&nbsp;<P>7. You connect two bulbs together and to a battery and observe thatboth light up. If you unscrew one bulb and the other goes out as well,this means that the bulbs were connected in<b><font size="+1"><BR><a href="../electric/dcex2.html#c1">a.&nbsp; series</a></b></font><BR>b. parallel<BR>c. can't tell from this information<P>8. Appliances in household circuits are wired in<BR>a. series<b><font size="+1"><BR><a href="../electric/dcex2.html#c1">b. parallel</a></b></font><BR>c. both series and parallel<P>9. If you measure a voltage of 12 volts across a resistor at the sametime that you measure 2 amperes of current through it, the resistance ofthe resistor is<BR>a. 24 ohms<BR>b. 1/6 ohms<b><font size="+1"><a href="../electric/ohmlaw.html#c1"><BR>c. 6 ohms</a></b></font><P>10. If you measure a voltage of 12 volts across a resistor at the sametime that you measure 2 amperes of current through it, the power beingused in the resistor is<b><font size="+1"><a href="../electric/elepow.html#c1"><BR>a. 24 watts</b></a></font><BR>b. 1/6 watt<BR>c. 6 watts<P>11. From your exposure to the nature of metals in the geology, chemistryand physics portions of the class, state your understanding of why metalsconduct electricity well while most other substances don't.<BR>&nbsp;<p>The outer or valence <a href="../electric/conins.html#c1">electrons in metals</a> may move freely through the material, whereas all electrons are tightly bound to their atoms in insulating materials. </p><BR>&nbsp;<P>12. Why must there be two connections to a battery and to a light bulb?<BR>&nbsp;<p>The flow of current in a battery-powered circuit is analogous to the <a href="../electric/watcir.html#c1">flow of water in a pump-powered loop of pipe</a> - the wires of the  circuit must make a complete loop for the current to flow continuously.</p><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>13. Two like electric charges<BR>&nbsp;a. always attract each other<BR>&nbsp;<b><font size="+1"><a href="../electric/elefor.html#c1">b. always repel each other</a></b></font><BR>&nbsp;c. neutralize each other<BR>&nbsp;d. have no effect on each other<BR>&nbsp;e. must be neutrons.<P>14. The force which holds atoms together to form molecules is<BR>&nbsp;<b><font size="+1"><a href="../forces/funfor.html#c3">a. electrical</a></b></font><BR>&nbsp;b. magnetic<BR>&nbsp;c. gravitational<BR>&nbsp;d. mystical<P>15. Electrons flowing in a wire is analogous to water flowing in a pipe."Electric current" is analogous to the volume flowrate of the water, andvoltage is analogous to<BR>&nbsp;<b><font size="+1"><a href="../electric/watcir.html#c2">a. pressure</a></b></font><BR>&nbsp;b. resistance<BR>&nbsp;c. amount of water<BR>&nbsp;d. work<BR>&nbsp;e. velocity of flow<P>16.&nbsp; A device which transforms electric energy into mechanicalenergy is a<BR>&nbsp;<b><font size="+1"><a href="../magnetic/elemot.html#c1">a. motor</a></b></font>&nbsp; c. transformer<BR>&nbsp;b. generator&nbsp; d. magnet<P>17. In the use of electricity in your home, it can be said that<BR>&nbsp;a. electric charge and electric energy are used to operate theappliances<BR><b><font size="+1"><a href="../electric/hsehld2.html#c1">b. electric charge is taken in at a high voltage like 120 volts andthe energy is used, after which the electric charge is transferred to theearth at 0 volts.</a></b></font><BR>c. electric charge flows through the appliances without be affectedin any way and is returned to where it came from.<P>18. The velocity of a sound wave depends upon the<BR>a. frequency of the wave<BR>b. amplitude<BR>c. pitch of the sound<b><font size="+1"><BR><a href="../sound/souspe.html#c1">d. medium through which it travels</a></b></font><P>19. The speed of sound in air is 340 m/s. The wavelength in air of asound wave of frequency 170 Hz is<b><font size="+1"><BR><a href="../wavrel.html#c2">a. 2 m</a></b></font><BR>b. 0.5 m<BR>c. 4 m<BR>d. 510 m<P>20. Light rays coming from a fish under water and entering the air atan angle other than 90&deg;<b><font size="+1"><BR><a href="../geoopt/refr.html#c1">a. will be bent downward toward the water surface</a></b></font><BR>b. will be bent upward toward the vertical<BR>c. will not be bent<BR>d. may be bend upward or downward, depending upon the color of thelight<P>21. The property of light which makes possible the formation of clearimages by the eye is<BR>a. reflection<b><font size="+1"><BR><a href="../vision/rfreye.html#c1">b. refraction</a></b></font><BR>c. diffraction<BR>d. interference<P>22. A tube is filled with water and then the water is gradually loweredwhile sounding a 1000 Hz tuning fork above the tube. The sound becomeslouder when the distance to the water surface is 8.5 cm, showing that theair column resonant frequency is the same as the tuning fork frequency.Neglecting end corrections, this tells you that the sound wavelength isabout<BR>a. 8.5 cm<BR>b. 17 cm<BR>c. 25.5 cm<b><font size="+1"><BR><a href="../waves/clocol2.html#c2">d. 34 cm</a></b></font><P>23. To accomodate for viewing close objects, the eye's lens must changeits<b><font size="+1"><BR><a href="../vision/accom.html#c1">a. focal length</a></b></font><BR>b. image distance<BR>c. aperture<BR>e. iris opening<P>24. For a normal eye, parallel light beams would be focused to a doton the retina. Describe what happens in the eye of a nearsighted personand how you correct nearsightedness.<BR>&nbsp;<p>In the <a href="../vision/eyedef.html#c4">nearsighted</a> eye, light is refracted too much and parallel incident rays are made to focus before they reach the retina. Nearsightedness is corrected with a negative lens which cancels the excess focusing power.</p><BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>25. Blue light differs from red light in that<BR>a. its intensity is greater<b><font size="+1"><BR><a href="../vision/specol.html#c2">b. its frequency is higher</a></b></font><BR>c. its wavelength is longer<BR>d. its quantum energy is lower<P>26. Physiological damage from x-rays is fundamentally different fromthat caused by microwaves because<BR>&nbsp;<b><font size="+1"><a href="../mod4.html#c3">a. the x-rays cause ionization and the microwaves cannot</a></b></font><BR>&nbsp;b. the total power you get from microwaves is higher<BR>&nbsp;c. microwaves are electromagnetic waves and xrays are not<BR>&nbsp;d. microwaves have shorter wavelengths<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>27. The color you would get by mixing equal amounts of green and redlight would be<table><tr><td>  <a href="../vision/newtcol.html#c1"> <b><font size="+1"><BR>a. yellow</a></b></font><BR>b. white<BR>c. blue<BR>d. magenta<BR>&nbsp;</td><td><img src ="phscilab/imglab/newtcol-2.gif"></td></tr></table><BR>28. The color you would get by mixing equal amounts of yellow and bluelight would be<BR>a. red<b><font size="+1"><BR><a href="../vision/newtcol.html#c1">b. white</a></b></font><BR>c. blue<BR>f. magenta<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>29. Name two similarities and two differences in the properties of soundand light.<BR>&nbsp;<p>Since both sound and light are waves, they have a number of common properties. Each has wavelength, frequency, and each experiences reflection, refraction, diffraction and interference. They are however very different in many respects: sound must have a medium to travel in, light can travel through empty space. Light is much faster. Light is electromagnetic in nature, while sound is mechanical. </p><BR>&nbsp;<P>30. When a real image of an object is formed on a screen by a lens,the image must be<BR><font size="+1"><BR><a href="../vision/newtcol.html#c1">a. inverted</a></b></font><BR>b. larger than the object<BR>c. smaller than the object<BR>d. none of the above is necessarily true.<BR>&nbsp;<P>31. You are told that your electric water heater is almost 100% efficientin using the electric energy to heat water. This is misleading because<BR>&nbsp;<font size="+1"><BR><a href="../thermo/seclaw2.html#c1">a. It takes about three units of fuel to generate one unit ofelectrical energy.</a></b></font><BR>&nbsp;b. More heat is lost through the heater walls than you mightthink<BR>c. Gas water heaters use the gas more efficiently than the electricheater uses the electricity.<P>32. If a heat engine operates at 600K (hot reservoir) and gives offheat at 300K its maximum efficiency is<BR>&nbsp;<font size="+1"><BR><a href="../thermo/carnot.html#c1"><b>a. 50%</a></b></font>&nbsp; c. 100%<BR>&nbsp;b. 200%&nbsp; d. 95%<BR>This limitation is placed on it by<BR>&nbsp;e. friction<BR>&nbsp;<font size="+1"><BR><a href="../thermo/carnot.html#c1"><b>f. the second law of thermodynamics</a></b></font><BR>&nbsp;g. the conservation of energy principle<BR>&nbsp;h. the General Motors Corporation<P>33. If an air column musical instrument like a flute is made shorter,then its pitch will be<BR>a. higher because the wavelength is longer and the sound speed faster<BR>b. lower because the wavelength is shorter and the sound speed is thesame<BR><font size="+1"><BR><a href="../waves/opecol2.html#c1">c. higher because the wavelength is shorter and the sound speed isthe same</a></b></font><BR>d. higher because the wavelength is shorter and the sound speed ishigher<P>34. The changing granulation of the solar surface represents.<BR>&nbsp;a) absorbing regions of chlorine gas<b><font size="+1"><BR>&nbsp;b) convection cells of rising and sinking gases</b></font><BR>&nbsp;c) electron transitions between the 3 and 2 orbital in Hydrogen<BR>&nbsp;d) blurred vision of an astronomer after being on a Corona binge<BR>&nbsp;<P>35. How does the temperature and magnetic field in a sunspot compare toits general surroundings?<BR>&nbsp;a) hotter with stronger magnetic field<BR>&nbsp;b) hotter with weaker magnetic field<BR>&nbsp;c) cooler with weaker magnetic field<b><font size="+1"><BR>&nbsp;d) cooler with stronger magnetic field</b></font><BR>&nbsp;e) similar temperature and magnetic field<P>36. The "energy currency" for the cell is:<BR>d. actin<BR>e. myosin<b><font size="+1"><BR>f. ATP</b></font><BR>g. glucose<P>37. All of the following molecules are commonly&nbsp; used by livingthings for energy storage except:<BR>e. glycogen<b><font size="+1"><BR>f. lactic acid</b></font><BR>g. cellulose<BR>h. starch<P>38. Muscle contraction is an example of:<b><font size="+1"><BR>a. mechanical work</b></font><BR>b. electrical work<BR>c. nuclear work<BR>d. synthetic work<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<A HREF="../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="nts3001-4.html#c1">     NSCI 3001</A></BODY>
