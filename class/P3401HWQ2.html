It has an initialtemperature of 100&deg;C or 373K.<BR>&nbsp;It's mass is 320 grams.<P>1. a. Find the initial cooling rate in watts for this potato. Assumeit to be an ideal blackbody radiator.<P>Power = sigma*area*T^4<BR>area=4*pi*r^2= 0.0201 m^2<BR>Power = 5.67e-08*.0201*373^4=&nbsp; 22.06 watts<p>If the environment is at 20 C = 293K, then there will be some radiation to the potato, so if it were			a perfect absorber it would take in heat at a rate:	</p>		<p>Power = 5.67e-08*.0201*293^4=		8.4	watts</p><p>So the net cooling rate would be		13.66	watts</p>		<P>b. Find the wavelength of the peak of the radiation curve.<P>peak wavelength = .0029/373 =&nbsp; 7.7748E-06 m= 7774.8 nm<P>c. Assuming that all photons have the energy of the Wien peak, findthe number of photons per second emitted.<P>Photon energy of Wien peak = 1240 eVnm/7775nm =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.159eV<P>Number of photons = 22.06 watts/(0.159*1.6e-19)=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.67E+20photons/s<BR>&nbsp;<P>2. Suppose you want the hot potato to cool to 80&deg;C to eat it. Calculatethe radiative cooling time to this<BR>temperature. Assume that it is an ideal radiator and that the averagemolecular mass in the potato is 30<BR>(a wild guess, like two carbons and 6 hydrogens on average). Assumethat each molecule has 3kT/2 of<BR>energy. Discuss any further assumptions you make.<P>Cooling time = (Nk/2*sigma*A)(1/Tcold^3-1/Thot^3)<BR>320grams would by 320/30 =&nbsp; 10.66666667 moles = 6.42133E+24 molecules= N<P>time = (6.42e24*1.38e-23J/K/(2*5.67e-8*.020m^2))*(1/353^3-1/373^3) =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135. sec<BR>Neglecting environmental transfer back to the potato</p><p>This is too short a time, because we have neglected reabsorption of heat from the environment, which will					be assumed to be 293K, giving a reabsorption rate of 8.4 watts. 					The net cooling rate at 80 C = 353K would be 			17.70	watts with no reabsorption.	The integral with reabsorpton in it is a little too hard to do, so we can estimate the lengthening of the					cooling by seeing that the reabsorption slows the initial cooling by 8.4/22=38%, and the final cooling rate					by 8.4/17.7 = 48%. Taking the average of43% gives cooling time estimate 135s/.57=237 sec.</p>					<P>3. A certain short-lived charged particle has an average lifetime of10-13 sec. Assuming that it is<BR>emitted at a speed of 0.98c. Being a charged particle, it leaves avisible track in a laboratory frame<BR>detector medium. How long do you expect the average track to be?<P>Lab frame halflife dilated to 5e-13<BR>Track length = 0.98*3e8*5e-13=&nbsp; 0.000147 m = 0.147 mm<BR>&nbsp;<P>4. You have erected a tower on top of Stone Mountain to do a local repetitionof the muon experiment. You<BR>have a detector at 500 m height and another identical one at groundlevel at the base of the mountain. The<BR>rest frame half-life of the muon is 1.56 x 10-6 sec. Presuming thatin an hour's time you detect 1000<BR>muons at the top detector, how many do you expect to detect at thelower detector.&nbsp; Assume that there is a<BR>uniform flux of muons at speed 0.99c. Show that the result is the sameas seen from the earth frame and<BR>the muon frame.<P>Relativity factor 7.08<P>From earth frame, time = 500m/(.98*3e8m/s) =&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.7007E-06sec<BR>Halflife seen as dilated to 1.56e-6*7.08 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.10E-05sec<BR>Number of halflives =&nbsp; 0.154<BR>Number at earth = 1000*(2^-.154)=&nbsp;&nbsp; 898.8<P>From muon frame,length is contracted to 500/7.08=&nbsp;&nbsp; 70.62m<BR>The time is then 70.6/(.98*3e8)=&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.40E-07<BR>The number of halflives is then = 2.4e-7 /1.56e-6=&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.54E-01<BR>so the final result is the same.<BR>&nbsp;<P>5. A space ship traveling at 0.6c is approached by another ship whichfrom an external reference frame<BR>is traveling at 0.8c toward the first ship.<P>a. What approach speed would the first ship measure for the second ship?<P>vapproach = (0.6 + 0.8)/(1+(0.6*0.8))=&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.9459 c<P>b.If the first ship is propelled by an ion drive which ejects ions at0.7c compared to the ship, with what<BR>&nbsp;speed would an external observer see those ions traveling?<P>v = (0.6 -0.7)/(1-(.6*.7))=&nbsp; -0.1724 c<BR>&nbsp;<P>6. Taking a rough estimate of the blackbody curve of a radiator forwhich the spectrum peaks in the middle<BR>&nbsp;of the visible range, it appears that about 37% of the radiatedenergy is in the visible.<P>a. What temperature would the radiating surface have to be to peak at550nm?<P>T=.0029/550e-9=&nbsp; 5272.7 K<P>b. What area of radiating surface would be required to&nbsp; produce1000 watts of power in the visible range<BR>if the surface is assumed to be an ideal radiator?</p><p>Total power radiated = 1000/.37 =2702.7	watts	</p><p>A=2703/(sigma*T^4)=		6.167E-05	m^2 =	0.617	cm^2</p><P>7. a. Find the momentum of an electron which has a kinetic<BR>&nbsp;energy of 1000 eV and one which has a kinetic energy of 1000MeV.<BR>pc=sqrt((1000eV+511000eV)^2-511000^2) =&nbsp;&nbsp; 31984. eV<BR>pc=sqrt((1000MeV+ .511MeV)^2-.511^2) =&nbsp;&nbsp; 1000.51MeV<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>b. Find the momentum of photons with the same energy.<BR>pc=E for photon, so pc=1000eV and 1000MeV</BODY>
