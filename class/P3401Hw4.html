Earthbound twin determines time to be shorter in travelersframe.<BR>&nbsp;b. In the absence of acceleration, the traveler would measurethe earthbound twin's time to be shorter.<BR>&nbsp;c. The acceleration is in the travelers frame, so the earth frameis considered to be the inertial frame.<BR>&nbsp;The traveling twin would be younger.<P>13.
