Joe estimates that on his drive to work, he sees one flattened possumon the road about every three weeks.<BR>&nbsp;Mike, who has just begun to ride to work with him, has neverseen this, having come from Arizona where<BR>they run over skunks instead. How many weeks will Mike have to ridewith Joe to have a 90% confidence<BR>of seeing at least one possum on the road?<P>The mean is 1/3 per week, and with small numbers, Poisson statisticsare appropriate.<P>Calculating the probability of seeing no possums and setting it equalto 10%:<P>0.1 = exp(-a)<BR>ln(.1)=-a;&nbsp;&nbsp; a= 2.30<BR>np=a; n=a/p=3a= 6.91&nbsp; so almost 7 weeks to be 90% sure.<P>2. The element potassium is reported to have one of the larger atomicradii, and may be a counterexample<BR>to Rohlf's universal 0.3 nm atom. If the density of solid is 0.86 gm/cm3and its molar mass is 39.1 grams,<BR>calculate the atomic radius. State clearly any assumptions you make.<P>The volume per atom can be calculated from v= molar mass/(density*avogadro'snumber)<BR>volume = (.0391 kg/mole)/(860 kg/m^3*6.022e23 atoms/mole) =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.55E-29 m^3/atom<BR>Taking the volume as a simple cube gives diameter =&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.2E-10m = 0.423 nm<P>3. Lay out all the possible ways that 3 particles can have 4 units ofenergy, and calculate the number of<BR>states associated with each configuration.<P>&nbsp;Energy =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 1 2 3 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weighting<BR>Number of part.&nbsp; 2 0 0 0 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 1 0 1 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 0 2 0 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 2 1 0 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3<P>4. Protons from the solar wind get placed into spiral paths toward theNorth pole by the Earth's magnetic<BR>field, contributing to auroral displays. If the Earth's magnetic fieldis 0.5 E-4 Tesla, and the<BR>component of the proton's velocity perpendicular to the that fieldis 1E4 m/s, what is the radius of the<BR>circular crosssection of the spiral path?<P>mv^2/r=qvB, r=mv/qB= (1.67e-27kg*1e4 m/s)/(1.6e-19C*0.5e-4T)=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.0875 m<P>5. Deuterium-tritium fusion to form an alpha particle and a neutronoffers probably the greatest hope for<BR>generating electricity by nuclear fusion. The mass energies of theconstituents are given below.<P>deuterium 1.8756 GeV<BR>tritium 2.8089 GeV<BR>alpha 3.7274 GeV<BR>neutron 0.9396 GeV<P>Calculate the energy yield of the fusion process and the speed of thelone neutron if it receives all<BR>energy of the process.<P>Mass difference = 0.0175 GeV= 2.8E-12 joules<BR>v=sqrt(2E/m)=sqrt(2*2.8e-12J/1.6749e-27)=&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.78E+07 m/s&nbsp;= 0.19c<BR>&nbsp;<P>6. You are told that air molecules collide about 5 billion times persecond. Does than make sense?<BR>Calculate the collision rate assuming an average molar mass of 29,a temperature 0&deg;C, and atmospheric<BR>pressure. State any assumptions made.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Average speed =&nbsp; sqrt(8kT/pi*m) = sqrt(8*1.38e-23*273/(Pi()*29*1.66e-27))=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;446.41 m/s<P>Mean free path= volume per atom/cross section for collision = 0.0224m^3/(pi*(.3nm)^2*6.02e23*1e-18)<P>&nbsp;mean free path= 1.316E-07 m<P>Rate of collisions = average speed/mean free path =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.39E+09&nbsp; /s</BODY>
