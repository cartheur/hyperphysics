Your task is to determine energies for particles in a particle beamto investigate a crystal with lattice<BR>spacing 0.1 nm, so to see diffraction effects you want to have a wavelengthof at least twice the lattice<BR>spacing, 0.2 nm.<P>a. What kinetic energy would be required for electrons?<BR>This is in non-relativistic range.<BR>pc=hc/wavelength=1240 eV nm/0.2nm=&nbsp;&nbsp; 6200 eV<BR>E=p^2/2m = (pc)^2/2*mc^2 =(6200 eV)^2/2*511000 eV =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37.61 eV<P>b. What kinetic energy would be required for neutrons?<BR>E=p^2/2m = (pc)^2/2*mc^2 =(6200 eV)^2/2*940E6 eV =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.0204 eV<BR>&nbsp;<P>2. A given nucleus has a diameter of about 10 fermis (10 x 10-15 m).To resolve any detail about<BR>this nucleus, you would need a wavelength of about half this diameter,or 5 fermis.<P>a. What energy x-rays would be required?<BR>E=hf=hc/wavelength=1240 eV nm/5E-6 nm=&nbsp;&nbsp; 248 MeV&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think so!<P>b. What electron kinetic energy would give this wavelength?<BR>KE=sqrt((pc)^2+(mc^2)^2)-mc^2<BR>pc=248 MeV KE= 247.490 MeV&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This would requirean accelerator of some kind, but it is doable.<BR>&nbsp;<P>3. Given that you have only about 10 MeV of energy available, show thatyou cannot contain an electron<BR>in&nbsp; a nucleus of diameter 10 fermis. You may use the uncertaintyprinciple in a variety of different ways,<BR>but make sure you state your assumptions clearly.<P>Try 3D particle in box with dimension equal to diameter.<BR>&lt;E>=9*hbar^2/2*m*L^2= 9*(hbar*c)^2/(2*m*c^2*L^2) = 9*(197 MeV fm)^2/(2*.511MeV*10^2fm^2)<BR>&lt;E>= 3417.622309 MeV<P>delta p*c= hbar*c/2*delta x = 197 eV nm/(2*10E-6 nm) =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9850000 eV<BR>assuming delta p*c of same range as pc, KE=sqrt((pc)^2+(mc^2)^2)-mc^2=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9352245.967 eV<P>Show that a proton can be contained with that energy.<P>&lt;E> = 9*(197 MeV fm)^2/(2*939 MeV*10^2fm^2)<BR>&lt;E>= 1.85985623 MeV<P>Using uncertainty principle as above<BR>assuming delta p*c of same range as pc, KE=sqrt((pc)^2+(mc^2)^2)-mc^2=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 51661.25192 eV<P>4. Calculate the wavelengths of electrons with kinetic energy 10 eV,10 MeV, and 1 GeV and show which<BR>cases must be treated relativistically by comparing non-relativisticand relativistic results.<P>a. 10 eV Relativistic wavelength = hc/pc=hc/(sqrt((KE+mc^2)^2-(mc^2)^2)<BR>&nbsp;Non-relativistic wavelength = hc/(sqrt(2*mc^2*KE))<BR>&nbsp;Relativistic wavelength =&nbsp; 0.387877076 nm<BR>&nbsp;Non-relativistic wavelength =&nbsp; 0.387878973 nm non rel OK<P>a. 10 MeV Relativistic wavelength = hc/pc=hc/(sqrt((KE+mc^2)^2-(mc^2)^2)<BR>&nbsp;Non-relativistic wavelength = hc/(sqrt(2*mc^2*KE))<BR>&nbsp;Relativistic wavelength =&nbsp; 0.000118111 nm<BR>&nbsp;Non-relativistic wavelength =&nbsp; 0.000387879 nm X must userel<P>a. 1 GeV Relativistic wavelength = hc/pc=hc/(sqrt((KE+mc^2)^2-(mc^2)^2)<BR>&nbsp;Non-relativistic wavelength = hc/(sqrt(2*mc^2*KE))<BR>&nbsp;Relativistic wavelength =&nbsp; 1.23937E-06 nm<BR>&nbsp;Non-relativistic wavelength =&nbsp; 3.87879E-05 nm X must userel</BODY>
