If equal masses of copper and water are heated from 10&deg;C to 20&deg;C<BR>a. more heat will be required for the copper<BR>b. more heat will be required for the water<BR>c. the same amount of heat will be required for each<P>2. If a mass of hot metal shot is dumped into a cool cup of water andallowed to reach a final temperature<BR>a. the amount of heat lost by the metal shot is equal to the heat gainedby the water<BR>b. the heat loss by the metal shot is greater than that gained by thewater<BR>c. the amount of heat gained or lost by the copper and water are notrelated since they are very different substances<P>3. When you measure the temperature of an object with a thermometer,this temperature is a measure of<BR>a. the total energy of the molecules of the object<BR>b. the potential energy which holds the molecules together<BR>c. the energy of the motion of the molecules<BR>d. the amount of heat possessed by the object<P>4. The amount of heat required to increase the temperature of one gramof water by 1&deg;C is called a calorie. The amount of heat required tomelt a gram of ice at 0&deg;C into a gram of water at 0&deg;C is<BR>a. much more than a calorie<BR>b. much less than a calorie<BR>c. about a calorie<BR>d. nonsense! You can't have water and ice both at 0&deg;C<P>5. If you have&nbsp; a piece of wood and a piece of metal at the sametemperature, 0&deg;C, which would feel colder to the touch and why?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>6. A refrigerator<BR>&nbsp;a. produces cold<BR>&nbsp;b. causes heat to vanish<BR>&nbsp;c. removes heat from a region and transports it to a warmer region<BR>&nbsp;d. changes heat to cold<BR>&nbsp;<P>7. You connect two bulbs together and to a battery and observe thatboth light up. If you unscrew one bulb and the other goes out as well,this means that the bulbs were connected in<BR>a.&nbsp; series<BR>b. parallel<BR>c. can't tell from this information<P>8. Appliances in household circuits are wired in<BR>a. series<BR>b. parallel<BR>c. both series and parallel<P>9. If you measure a voltage of 12 volts across a resistor at the sametime that you measure 2 amperes of current through it, the resistance ofthe resistor is<BR>a. 24 ohms<BR>b. 1/6 ohms<BR>c. 6 ohms<P>10. If you measure a voltage of 12 volts across a resistor at the sametime that you measure 2 amperes of current through it, the power beingused in the resistor is<BR>a. 24 watts<BR>b. 1/6 watt<BR>c. 6 watts<P>11. From your exposure to the nature of metals in the geology, chemistryand physics portions of the class, state your understanding of why metalsconduct electricity well while most other substances don’t.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>12. Why must there be two connections to a battery and to a light bulb?<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>13. Two like electric charges<BR>&nbsp;a. always attract each other<BR>&nbsp;b. always repel each other<BR>&nbsp;c. neutralize each other<BR>&nbsp;d. have no effect on each other<BR>&nbsp;e. must be neutrons.<P>14. The force which holds atoms together to form molecules is<BR>&nbsp;a. electrical<BR>&nbsp;b. magnetic<BR>&nbsp;c. gravitational<BR>&nbsp;d. mystical<P>15. Electrons flowing in a wire is analogous to water flowing in a pipe."Electric current" is analogous to the volume flowrate of the water, andvoltage is analogous to<BR>&nbsp;a. pressure<BR>&nbsp;b. resistance<BR>&nbsp;c. amount of water<BR>&nbsp;d. work<BR>&nbsp;e. velocity of flow<P>16.&nbsp; A device which transforms electric energy into mechanicalenergy is a<BR>&nbsp;a. motor&nbsp; c. transformer<BR>&nbsp;b. generator&nbsp; d. magnet<P>17. In the use of electricity in your home, it can be said that<BR>&nbsp;a. electric charge and electric energy are used to operate theappliances<BR>b. electric charge is taken in at a high voltage like 120 volts andthe energy is used, after which the electric charge is transferred to theearth at 0 volts.<BR>c. electric charge flows through the appliances without be affectedin any way and is returned to where it came from.<P>18. The velocity of a sound wave depends upon the<BR>a. frequency of the wave<BR>b. amplitude<BR>c. pitch of the sound<BR>d. medium through which it travels<P>19. The speed of sound in air is 340 m/s. The wavelength in air of asound wave of frequency 170 Hz is<BR>a. 2 m<BR>b. 0.5 m<BR>c. 4 m<BR>d. 510 m<P>20. Light rays coming from a fish under water and entering the air atan angle other than 90&deg;<BR>a. will be bent downward toward the water surface<BR>b. will be bent upward toward the vertical<BR>c. will not be bent<BR>d. may be bend upward or downward, depending upon the color of thelight<P>21. The property of light which makes possible the formation of clearimages by the eye is<BR>a. reflection<BR>b. refraction<BR>c. diffraction<BR>d. interference<P>22. A tube is filled with water and then the water is gradually loweredwhile sounding a 1000 Hz tuning fork above the tube. The sound becomeslouder when the distance to the water surface is 8.5 cm, showing that theair column resonant frequency is the same as the tuning fork frequency.Neglecting end corrections, this tells you that the sound wavelength isabout<BR>a. 8.5 cm<BR>b. 17 cm<BR>c. 25.5 cm<BR>d. 34 cm<BR>&nbsp;<P>23. To accomodate for viewing close objects, the eye's lens must changeits<BR>a. focal length<BR>b. image distance<BR>c. aperture<BR>e. iris opening<P>24. For a normal eye, parallel light beams would be focused to a doton the retina. Describe what happens in the eye of a nearsighted personand how you correct nearsightedness.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>25.

Name two similarities and two differences in the properties of soundand light.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<P>30. When a real image of an object is formed on a screen by a lens,the image must be<BR>a. inverted<BR>b. larger than the object<BR>c. smaller than the object<BR>d. none of the above is necessarily true.<BR>&nbsp;<P>31. You are told that your electric water heater is almost 100% efficientin using the electric energy to heat water. This is misleading because<BR>&nbsp;a. It takes about three units of fuel to generate one unit ofelectrical energy.<BR>&nbsp;b. More heat is lost through the heater walls than you mightthink<BR>c. Gas water heaters use the gas more efficiently than the electricheater uses the electricity.<P>32. If a heat engine operates at 600K (hot reservoir) and gives offheat at 300K its maximum efficiency is<BR>&nbsp;a. 50%&nbsp; c. 100%<BR>&nbsp;b. 200%&nbsp; d. 95%<BR>This limitation is placed on it by<BR>&nbsp;e. friction<BR>&nbsp;f. the second law of thermodynamics<BR>&nbsp;g. the conservation of energy principle<BR>&nbsp;h. the General Motors Corporation<P>33. If an air column musical instrument like a flute is made shorter,then its pitch will be<BR>a. higher because the wavelength is longer and the sound speed faster<BR>b. lower because the wavelength is shorter and the sound speed is thesame<BR>c. higher because the wavelength is shorter and the sound speed isthe same<BR>d. higher because the wavelength is shorter and the sound speed ishigher<P>34. The changing granulation of the solar surface represents.<BR>&nbsp;a) absorbing regions of chlorine gas<BR>&nbsp;b) convection cells of rising and sinking gases<BR>&nbsp;c) electron transitions between the 3 and 2 orbital in Hydrogen<BR>&nbsp;d) blurred vision of an astronomer after being on a Corona binge<P>35. How does the temperature and magnetic field in a sunspot compareto its general surroundings?<BR>&nbsp;a) hotter with stronger magnetic field<BR>&nbsp;b) hotter with weaker magnetic field<BR>&nbsp;c) cooler with weaker magnetic field<BR>&nbsp;d) cooler with stronger magnetic field<BR>&nbsp;e) similar temperature and magnetic field<P>36. The "energy currency" for the cell is:<BR>d. actin<BR>e. myosin<BR>f. ATP<BR>g. glucose<P>37.
