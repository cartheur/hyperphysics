The calculation of tunneling probability for an alpha particle outof a nucleus involves<BR>approximating the coulomb barrier with a series of barriers of differentheight. An alpha<BR>particle has energy 8 MeV inside the nucleus. Approximate the barrierwith two<BR>rectangular barriers of width 5 fm, the first at height 20 MeV andthe second at height<BR>10 MeV.
