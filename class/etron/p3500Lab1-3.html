Circuits</H1>Reference: Simpson Ch 1, Appendices A & C<p>Objective: To become familiar with Ohm's law, Kirchoff's laws and their use inanalyzing basic D.C. Circuits containing only resistors.</p><p>Procedure: Digital multimeters will be used for the voltage and currentmeasurements.  Refer to the description of the multimeter in the labmanual for further details.  The voltage will be obtained from the Pascopower supply (refer to the instructions).  Note that part IIIB can bedone outside of lab.</p><p>I. Series Circuits: <br>A. Wire the circuit shown in Figure 1. <br><center><img src="p3500e1f1-2.gif"></center><center>Figure 1</center><OL><LI>Measure and record the values for the current, the voltageacross R1 (VR1)  , the voltage across R2 (VR2), and the supply voltage. Remove, measure and record the values of your resistors.</LI><LI>In order to have the meters read in the "forward" direction theconnections to the + and - meter terminals must be one of thetwo possibilities.<ul><li>Sketch your circuit showing its working connections</li><li>Justify the connections in terms of Ohm's law and thedirection of current flow.</li></ul></li><li>Calculate the current based on the resistance values (see thetext for a color code chart) and compare it with the result frompart 1.  If there is a difference, is it reasonable?</li></ol>B. Calculate the equivalent resistance for R1 in series with R2.  Replacethem with Req and measure the current.  Compare the result with thatfrom part A.1.  Is the comparison reasonable?</p><p>II. Parallel Circuits<br>A. Wire the circuit shown in Figure 2. <center><img src="p3500e1f2-2.gif"></center><center>Figure 2</center><ol><li> Measure and record the voltages across R1 and R2 and the power supply. Record your resistor values. Show on asketch the connections of the + and - meter leads.</li><li>Insert the milliammeter into the circuit in each of the locations(A1), (A2), and (A3) in turn.  Record each reading, and show on asketch the orientation of the + and - connections.</li><li>Compare the value of (I1) with those of (I2) and (I3).  Is thecomparison reasonable in terms of circuit theory? </li></ol>B. Compute the equivalent resistance of R1 in parallel withR2.  Replace them with Req and measure the current. Compare it with the results from part 2 above.  Is thecomparison reasonable?</p><p>III. More Complicated Circuit<br>A.Set up the circuit shown in Figure 3.<center><img src="p3500e1f3-2.gif"></center><center>Figure 3</center><ol><li>Double-check your wiring to be sure it is as the schematicshows.</li><li>Measure and record the voltages across each resistor.  Make asketch showing the polarity of the voltages as indicated by thepolarity of the voltages as indicated by the voltmeterconnections.  From the voltage across each R, calculate thecurrent through the resistors.</li></ol>B. Calculate theoretically the currents flowing in each resistor (includingthe direction) and compare the results with those obtained in part A. Is the comparison reasonable?</p>                         <A Name="c3"></A><center><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><tr><td><a href="dcckt-3.html">Sample data and setup</a></td></tr></table></center></TD><TD WIDTH="66"><a href="../../hframe.html">Index</a></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="17">&nbsp;<A HREF="../../hph.html"> HyperPhysics</A>*****<A HREF="p3500-3.html">     Physics 3500 </A></TD><TD><a href="Javascript:history.go(-1)">Go Back</a></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>
