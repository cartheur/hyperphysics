The physical rationale for that is that thecooling rate is very fast then,<BR>&nbsp;and that part of the cooling time is very small compared to theslower cooling as it approached<BR>&nbsp;the current earth temperature.<BR>&nbsp;Redefine C to be the constant after integration, which has afactor of 3 in denominator from integration<BR>&nbsp;The constant C above has N*3k/2 in the numerator and 3*Eartharea * Stefan Boltzmann constant in<BR>&nbsp;the denominator.<BR>&nbsp;To estimate the number of atoms in the earth, we can use thenominal atomic volume from Rohlf:<BR>&nbsp;Volume of atom =&nbsp; 1.00E-29 m^3<BR>&nbsp;Radius of earth = 6.40E+06 m<BR>&nbsp;Volume of earth= 1.10E+21 m^3<BR>&nbsp;Number of atoms in earth = N =&nbsp; 1.10E+50 atoms<BR>&nbsp;k 1.38066E-23 J/K<BR>&nbsp;Numerator of fraction = N3k/2 =&nbsp; 2.27E+27 J/K<BR>&nbsp;Area of earth 4 pi r^2 =&nbsp; 5.15E+14 m^2<BR>&nbsp;Stefans constant=&nbsp; 5.67E-08 W/(m^2 K^4)<BR>&nbsp;The constant C is then =&nbsp; 2.60E+19 seconds/K^3<BR>&nbsp;Dividing by the cube of 300K gives time =&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.62E+11seconds<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Time in years 30483.48924 years<P>#17 Naked person at South Pole<BR>&nbsp;The heat loss from a person by radiation is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmannlaw, and<BR>&nbsp;the standard statement is that about 2/3 of the energy loss isby radiation. Since we are<BR>&nbsp;estimating, assume all loss is by radiation.<BR>&nbsp;Another nominal figure is that the room temperature loss froma person at room temperature<BR>&nbsp;is about 90 watts on a 24 hour basis. If assume 34 C as skintemp and 22 C as room temperature,<BR>&nbsp;this gives an effective radiating area from Stefan-Boltzmannas Area =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.2 m^2<BR>&nbsp;Assume South Pole temperature =&nbsp;&nbsp; 210 K<BR>&nbsp;Body temperature given =&nbsp; 311 K<BR>&nbsp;Assuming ideal radiator (actually about 95%) then we get a lossrate of:<BR>&nbsp;Power radiated = 509 watts&nbsp; compared to nominal 90 wattloss rate.<BR>&nbsp;If the external temperature is at&nbsp;&nbsp; 290 K<BR>&nbsp;The loss rate is only&nbsp;&nbsp; 156 watts<BR>&nbsp;Assuming a body mass of 80 kg and an average mass of atom of18*1/.8 since we are 80% water,<BR>&nbsp;u&nbsp; 1.66E-27 kg<BR>&nbsp;Mass of atom in body =&nbsp; 3.735E-26 kg<BR>&nbsp;Number of atoms in body = N =&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1419E+27 atoms<BR>&nbsp;Average energy of those atoms = N3kT/2<BR>&nbsp;k 1.38066E-23 J/K<BR>&nbsp;At 311K, N3kT/2 =&nbsp; 13795510.36 joules<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3295.63076 dietary Calories<P>#19 Energy density of cosmic background radiation.<BR>&nbsp;The average radiated energy given by the Stefan-Boltzmann relationshipis c/4 times the<BR>&nbsp;energy density.<BR>&nbsp;Radiated energy per unit area in watts/m^2 at 2.7K =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.01E-06 W/m^2<BR>&nbsp;The energy density at temperature = 2.7K is then 4/c times thatfigure:<BR>&nbsp;Energy density = 4.01E-14 joules/m^3<BR>&nbsp;<P>#22 Energy of photons from different sources<BR>&nbsp;Photon energy = h * frequency<BR>&nbsp;h =&nbsp; 4.14E-15 eV s<BR>&nbsp;a.

The levels are-54.4, -13.6,-6.04, -3.4, -2.18, -1.51<BR>&nbsp;Examination shows that the 6->4 transition of helium is the sameas the 3-2 of hydrogen to<BR>&nbsp;this level of approximation.<P>#44&nbsp; Lead K-alpha x-ray<BR>&nbsp;For lead, Z=82, but the effective Z for the K-alpha x-ray is81 since we presume that there<BR>&nbsp;is one electron in the n=1 shell so that the nucleus is shieldedby that electron.<BR>&nbsp;Other than the shielding, the energy levels are presumed to belike those of hydrogen<BR>&nbsp;and the n=2 to n=1 transition is then = (13.6*81^2*(1-1/4) =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66922.2 eV<BR>&nbsp;So we expect about a 67 keV xray.</BODY>
